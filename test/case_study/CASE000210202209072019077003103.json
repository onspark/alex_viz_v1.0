    "crime_fact": "Criminal Facts\n「2019고단3103」\nThe defendant is the actual operator of Corporation C, which aims to supply food ingredients, among other purposes.\nAround April 2017, in the office of Corporation C located on the 3rd floor in Jung-gu, Seoul, the defendant told Directors E and F of the victim company, Corporation B, \"I have arranged to supply snow crab from Canada to G, and if you lend me 350 million won, I will definitely repay the loan by June 20, 2017.\" E and F conveyed this message to H, the CEO of the victim company, around May 4, 2017, and the defendant met with H at a hotel in Jung-gu, Seoul, around May 10, 2017, and spoke to the same effect.\nHowever, at that time, to import snow crab from Canada, including customs clearance fees, at least 650 million won was needed, but despite having no means to secure funds other than the 350 million won borrowed from the victim company, the defendant lied to borrow money under the pretext of importing snow crab, intending to use it for company operating expenses and repayment of existing debts.\nAs a result, by deceiving H in the manner described above, the defendant received a transfer of 350 million won into the account of Corporation C at J Bank (account number omitted) under the pretext of a loan from the victim company on May 11 of the same year.\n「2019고단6753」\nThe defendant is a person who leases restaurants in hotels to operate hotel buffets.\n1. Fraud\nAround mid-January 2018, in the office of the victim L in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, the defendant lied to the victim, saying, \"I am currently leasing restaurants in various hotels to operate hotel buffets, but I am short of operating funds. If you lend me money, I will pay 8% interest monthly and will definitely repay it in 3 months.\"\nHowever, in reality, the defendant had been in a state of bad credit due to tax arrears since around 2000, and at the time of the said borrowing, was in a state of insolvency with debts exceeding 350 million won, and the buffet business operated by the defendant had been running at a loss continuously, failing to pay employees' wages, food ingredient costs, and various utility bills since around September 2017, thus having no intention or ability to repay the borrowed money.\nThe defendant, by deceiving the victim in this manner, received a transfer of 70 million won into the defendant's M account under the pretext of a loan around January 19, 2018, and embezzled it.\n2. Embezzlement in the Course of Duty\nThe defendant and L agreed to establish a new hotel buffet operating company, with L providing the entire startup capital of 50 million won and the defendant in charge of the company's operation, sharing the profits 50:50, and thus established Corporation N.\nOn February 12, 2018, the defendant received a transfer of 50 million won, the startup capital of the victim company, from L through P's Q Bank account in the name of the defendant's spouse, and between February 13 and February 20, 2018, arbitrarily used a total of 48.85 million won for personal purposes such as repaying the defendant's debts, paying wages of employees of another company operated by the defendant, and paying unpaid food ingredient costs, thereby embezzling it.\n「2020고단2492」\nThe defendant, while effectively operating the food distribution company Corporation C (CEO P), leases hotel restaurants to operate buffets through Corporation R (CEO S: operating T buffet), Corporation U (CEO V: operating W buffet), Corporation X (CEO Y: operating Z Myeongdong hotel buffet), and Corporation AA (CEO AB: operating AC hotel buffet).\nAround early December 2017, on the 14th floor in Jung-gu, Seoul, at T, the defendant lied to the victim AE, saying, \"If you deliver the bakery ingredients as ordered, I will make the payment by the 5th of the following month.\" However, in reality, since around July 2016, after receiving investments of hundreds of millions of won from others and operating a buffet on the 14th floor of the hotel, the defendant rapidly expanded the business by operating 7 hotel restaurants including W restaurant and Z Myeongdong hotel as well as AC hotel from around February 2017, but due to accumulated debts and deficits of hundreds of millions of won, had been in arrears with employees' wages, food ingredient costs, and various utility bills since around September 2017, thus having no intention or ability to make the promised payment on the delivery costs.\nThe defendant, by deceiving the victim in this manner, received delivery of goods including peeled ginger and 17 other items worth 896,400 won on December 8, 2017, and from then until April 27, 2018, received a total of 26,232,577 won worth of goods in 106 instances as listed in the crime summary table.\n「2020고단3166」\nOn June 12, 2019, in the office of Corporation AG operated by the defendant on the 3rd floor in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, the defendant showed AI, a friend of the victim AH, a sales agreement promising to purchase Corporation AK, which owns 5 AJ apartments, for 60 billion won, and lied, saying, \"3 billion won of the 6 billion won deposit has already been paid, and with just another 3 billion won, we can acquire not only the 5 apartments owned by AK but also 11 apartments under lien. The profit will be at least 50 billion won, so if you lend me 3 billion won for just two weeks, I will give you 70 million won in interest. I will definitely repay the total of 370 million won, including the principal of 3 billion won and the interest, by June 27, 2019.\" However, in reality, 3 billion won of the 6 billion won contract deposit for purchasing Corporation AK had not been deposited, and even if the remaining 3 billion won were received from the victim, it would not be possible to acquire the 16 AJ apartments, thus having no intention or ability to repay the borrowed money and interest by the promised date.\nThe defendant, through deceiving the victim via AI in this manner, received a transfer of 3 billion won into the account of Corporation AK at AL Bank under the pretext of a loan on June 13, 2019.",

Particularly, this argument is based on speculation that does not directly prove the defendant's intent or actions, and it is also lacking in terms of relevance to the criminal facts and the strength of the evidence.",
