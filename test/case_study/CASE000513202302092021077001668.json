    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\nThe defendant was sentenced to 10 months in prison with a 2-year suspended sentence for fraud at the Suncheon branch of the Gwangju District Court on September 7, 2016, and the judgment became final on the 20th of the same month.\nThe defendant operates Corporation C, a company engaged in the wholesale and retail of aggregates, located in Hadong County, Gyeongsangnam-do.\n1. Fraud against Victim D\nAround August 17, 2011, in the office of Corporation C located on the 2nd floor in Gwangyang City, Jeollanam-do, the defendant lied to victim D, saying, \"If you provide oil, I will pay for the fuel every fortnight.\"\nHowever, in reality, the defendant was in a financially difficult situation, unable to pay wages to employees and having a debt of 65 million won, and thus had neither the intention nor the ability to pay for the fuel every fortnight even after receiving it from the victim.\nBy deceiving the victim in this manner, the defendant received fuel worth a total of 80,686,039 won from the victim from that time until around September 30 of the same year.\nThus, the defendant deceived the victim and received property.\n2. Fraud against Victim F\nOn August 9, 2011, in the office of H Corporation operated by victim F in Gwangyang City, Jeollanam-do, the defendant lied to the victim, saying, \"We supply aggregates to Russia. If you provide the aggregates handled by H, we will pay 8,700 won per cubic meter for stones larger than 40mm and 8,800 won per cubic meter for stones smaller than 25mm. We will deposit the payment the day after we receive the supply.\"\nHowever, in reality, the defendant was in a financially difficult situation, unable to pay wages to employees and having a debt of 65 million won, and thus had neither the intention nor the ability to pay for the aggregates even after receiving them from the victim.\nBy deceiving the victim in this manner, the defendant received aggregates worth a total of 78,127,490 won from the victim from that time until around September 20 of the same year.\nThus, the defendant deceived the victim and received property.\n3. Fraud against Victim I\nIn early August 2011, in the office of Limited Company K operated by victim I in Gwangyang City, Jeollanam-do, the defendant lied to the victim, saying, \"If you transport aggregates from the aggregate workshop of H located in Gwangyang City, G, to Gwangyang Port, we will pay a transportation fee of 2,700 won per cubic meter.\"\nHowever, in reality, the defendant was in a financially difficult situation, unable to pay wages to employees and having a debt of 65 million won, and thus had neither the intention nor the ability to pay the transportation fee even after having the aggregates transported by the victim.\nBy deceiving the victim in this manner, the defendant made the victim transport aggregates from around November of the same month until around September 21 of the same year, and did not pay the victim a total transportation fee of 15,954,840 won, thereby acquiring a financial benefit of the same amount.\nThus, the defendant deceived the victim and acquired a financial benefit.",

The defendant had neither the intention nor the capability to operate a C rice direct sales outlet or supply C rice to the victim, and planned to use the deposit for personal purposes. Therefore, this warrant does not accurately reflect the intentions and actions of the defendant, and the logical connection based on facts is weak. It includes a logical leap and is a claim that does not match the actual situation of the case.",
