    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\nThe defendant, after leasing part of a 5-story building located in Saha-gu, Busan, from the landlord BW around February 14, 2020, has been operating a sports center under the name 'BX' in the said building since around March 2020.\n1. Fraud Related to the Sale of Prepaid Memberships\nAround June 1, 2021, the defendant sent text messages or advertised to multiple people, including the victim AI, under the title \"June All-Sports Event,\" claiming to sell long-term prepaid memberships at a discounted price at the BX Sports Center he was operating. However, in reality, since leasing the sports center, the defendant had continuously failed to pay most of the monthly rent of 17 million won, leaving a small amount of the security deposit after deducting the unpaid rent. Consequently, after the landlord BW notified the termination of the lease agreement due to non-payment of rent, BW filed an application for a prohibition of real estate possession transfer against the defendant at the Busan District Court Western Branch on May 3, 2021, and a lawsuit for eviction on May 27, 2021. Therefore, the defendant had neither the intention nor the ability to allow the victims to use the sports center as per the contract even after selling them the prepaid memberships.\nThe defendant deceived the victims in this manner and received a transfer of 899,000 won on June 3, 2021, to his wife BY's Nonghyup Bank account under the guise of a fee for using the sports center for 12 months, among other instances. From around June 1, 2021, to August 5, 2021, he fraudulently obtained a total of 70,544,500 won from 118 victims through cash or card payments, as listed in the attached crime list.\n2. Fraud Regarding the Security Deposit to Victim BZ\nAround June 28, 2021, the defendant told victim BZ at the sports center, \"I will enter into a lease agreement allowing you to operate a snack bar in the women's bathhouse of BX Sports Center from around July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2023. Please give me 11,000,000 won for the security deposit and other fees.\" However, in reality, since leasing the sports center, the defendant had continuously failed to pay most of the monthly rent of 17 million won, leaving a small amount of the security deposit after deducting the unpaid rent. Consequently, after the landlord BW notified the termination of the lease agreement due to non-payment of rent, BW filed an application for a prohibition of real estate possession transfer against the defendant at the Busan District Court Western Branch on May 3, 2021, and a lawsuit for eviction on May 27, 2021. Therefore, the defendant had neither the intention nor the ability to allow the victim to use the snack bar during the lease period even after receiving the security deposit and other fees.\nThe defendant deceived the victim in this manner and received a transfer of 11,000,000 won on June 28, 2021, to his own IBK account under the guise of a security deposit, thereby embezzling it.",

    "target_reason": "Claim c00014 argues that it is unbelievable that the defendant was unaware of the overall plan or intent of the voice phishing organization. However, the basis of this claim, d00014, only mentions the fact that the defendant agreed to manage a relay device and was to receive three million won per month. This alone is insufficient to conclude that the defendant was clearly aware of the organization's overall plan or intent. Therefore, the basis of this claim does not directly prove the defendant's awareness of the overall plan or intent, weakening the validity of the claim. This indicates a weak logical connection between the claim and its basis, and thus, the warrant of claim c00014 can be considered weak.",
