    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\n[Basic Facts]\nThe telephone financial fraud organization operates call centers overseas, including in China, and commits the so-called voice phishing fraud by impersonating financial institutions and others to swindle money from an unspecified number of people. For the execution of the crime, the organization operates in a cell-structured manner, dividing roles among 'lurers' who entice an unspecified number of victims via phone calls, 'account recruiters' who gather bank accounts to be used in the crime, 'withdrawers' and 'collectors' who withdraw cash deposited into these accounts or collect money from victims to deliver it, and 'transfer agents', with a 'mastermind' overseeing and directing the overall crime plan. Utilizing the fact that victims would unsuspectingly answer calls if the caller ID on their mobile phones shows a domestic number, even if the call is made from abroad via the internet, the organization operates a relay office that mediates communication by installing a VoIP Gateway (Voice Over IP Gateway, a so-called 'relay device' that mediates calls between multiple mobile phones) to change international or internet phone numbers to domestic mobile phone numbers.\nThe defendant, around the end of March 2022, accepted an offer from 'Z', a member of the telephone financial fraud organization whom he met at a construction site, stating, \"I am starting a new business. If you install the equipment I send you in your vehicle and operate it from 9 AM to 6 PM, I will pay you a monthly allowance of 6 million won.\"\nAccordingly, the defendant received a relay device, LTE router, high-capacity battery, and power converter (hereinafter referred to as 'relay device, etc.') via courier at his residence in Gwonseon-gu, Suwon-si, from an unidentified member of the telephone financial fraud organization introduced by 'Z' (WeChat conversation name 'AB'), and on around April 27, 2022, installed them in a Sportage vehicle rented from 'AC Co., Ltd.' located in Ansan-si. Following 'AB's instructions, to avoid detection by investigative agencies, he drove around areas such as Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu, and Dongjak-gu in Seoul, relaying communications by altering the caller ID of phones used in telephone financial fraud.\n[Specific Crime Facts]\n1. Fraud\nThe defendant connected the internet to the relay device received from the unidentified member of the telephone financial fraud organization (WeChat conversation name 'AB') and changed the caller ID of the phones used by the organization to a domestic phone number (phone number omitted).\nAround May 2, 2022, an unidentified member of the telephone financial fraud organization called victim AD using the number altered through the relay device installed by the defendant, impersonating an IBK Industrial Bank employee, and lied, \"We will provide you with a debt consolidation loan.\" Another unidentified member, impersonating an AE Bank employee, lied again, saying, \"You have been suspended from payment due to a violation of the Financial Transactions Act for applying for a debt consolidation loan with another financial institution, but you can lift the suspension by paying the original loan amount of 16 million won in cash.\"\nHowever, in reality, the unidentified individuals were neither employees of IBK Industrial Bank nor AE Bank, and they had neither the intention nor the ability to provide a debt consolidation loan despite receiving money under the guise of a security deposit.\nNevertheless, the defendant conspired with the unidentified members of the telephone financial fraud organization to deceive the victim, leading the victim to hand over 12 million won in cash to a cash collector member of the telephone financial fraud organization on the street of Daemyeong-ro, Nam-gu, Daegu, around May 3, 2022, among other instances. From then until around June 29, 2022, through the relay device installed by the defendant, a total of 2,173,760,000 won was swindled from a total of 73 victims by calling them from domestic mobile phone numbers and impersonating financial institution employees, as listed in the attached crime summary table 1.\n2. Violation of the Telecommunications Business Act\na. Mediating Others' Communications\nNo one shall mediate or provide others' communications using the telecommunication services provided by a telecommunications business operator.\nAt the time and place mentioned in paragraph 1, the defendant enabled communication between the SIM bank, which contained SIMs connected to domestic mobile phone numbers, and the relay device provided and installed by the unidentified member of the telephone financial fraud organization (WeChat conversation name 'AB'), allowing the unidentified members of the organization to communicate with an unspecified number of people using a total of 355 domestic mobile phone numbers, as listed in the attached crime summary table 2.\nThus, the defendant conspired with the unidentified members of the telephone financial fraud organization to mediate others' communications using the telecommunication services provided by a telecommunications business operator.\nb. Operating an Unregistered Value-Added Telecommunications Business\nAnyone who wishes to operate a telecommunications business must register with the Minister of Science and ICT in accordance with Presidential Decree, including financial and technical capabilities, user protection plans, and other business plans as prescribed.\nAt the time and place mentioned in paragraph 1, the defendant, in conspiracy with the unidentified members of the telephone financial fraud organization, operated a value-added telecommunications business without registering with the Minister of Science and ICT, by installing the relay device, etc., and connecting it to the internet, thereby enabling the organization's members to communicate with unspecified individuals in Korea by converting the calls to domestic mobile phone numbers, as listed in the attached crime summary table 2.",

    "target_reason": "Explanation: w00013 argues that the defendant's acceptance of risk for profit, despite recognizing the possibility of crime, signifies implied intent. However, this is a weak argument due to the lack of direct evidence or clear logical connection to the defendant's psychological state. To claim implied intent, specific evidence or logic demonstrating that the defendant was aware of the crime's outcome and its possibility is required. Yet, w00013 only emphasizes that the defendant's actions were essential to the crime's composition, without presenting direct evidence or logic that the defendant actually recognized the outcome of the crime and accepted its risk. Therefore, this argument merely assumes the defendant's psychological state and lacks a logical connection to prove implied intent for the crime.",
