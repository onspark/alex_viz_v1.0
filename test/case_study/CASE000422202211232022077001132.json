    "crime_fact": "Crime Details\n1. Defendant B\nThe defendant, having been in contact with someone known as 'C' through an internet chat site, received an email from an unidentified person stating that 'C' had died and left an inheritance for the defendant. To receive the inheritance, fees for legal expenses and processing costs were needed. The defendant decided to deceive victims to raise the fees.\na. Fraud against victim D\nAround February 15, 2019, in the office of A located in Geoje City E, the defendant told the victim through A, \"A woman (C) I used to date died in Turkey, leaving an inheritance of 8.3 million dollars. To receive the inheritance, I need to make a passport and prepare some money, so could you lend me 1 million won? I can receive the inheritance in 2-3 months, and I will give you 2-3 times the amount of money you lend me.\"\nHowever, in reality, the defendant had only known 'C', whom he had never actually met, through an internet chat site and had falsely claimed 'C' to be his ex-girlfriend. The defendant had not verified the identity or death of 'C', nor the existence of the inheritance, and had no significant assets or income at the time, thus lacking the intention or ability to repay the borrowed money or fees for the supposed inheritance.\nEventually, by deceiving the victim in this manner, the defendant received a transfer of 1,000,000 won into an account under the name of A (account number omitted) from the victim on the same day, and between that time and around July 16, 2019, received a total of 52,020,000 won from the victim in 10 transactions as listed in the attached crime summary table (1).\nb. Fraud against victim G\nAround March 15, 2019, at an unknown location, the defendant told the victim over the phone, \"I need fees to receive an inheritance in Turkey. I will give you 1 billion won after receiving the inheritance and prize money.\"\nHowever, in reality, the defendant had only known 'C', whom he had never actually met, through an internet chat site and had falsely claimed 'C' to be his ex-girlfriend. The defendant had not verified the identity or death of 'C', nor the existence of the inheritance, and had no significant assets or income at the time, thus lacking the intention or ability to repay the borrowed money or fees for the supposed inheritance.\nFurthermore, from around July 2019, the defendant lied to the victim, claiming he would repay the borrowed money with winnings from lotteries in the United States and Africa, despite not having won any such lotteries.\nEventually, by deceiving the victim in this manner, the defendant received a transfer of 4,000,000 won into an account under his name (account number omitted) from the victim on the same day, and between that time and around August 30, 2019, received a total of 10,650,000 won from the victim in 8 transactions as listed in the attached crime summary table (2).\n2. Defendant A\nAround April 27, 2019, at an unknown location, the defendant lied to victim D over the phone, saying, \"There is a general meeting at I for J, and I need you to pay the expenses on my behalf. I will give it to you next Thursday.\"\nHowever, in reality, the defendant had no intention or ability to repay the victim, as he was burdened with personal debts amounting to approximately 132,100,000 won at the time.\nEventually, by deceiving the victim in this manner, the defendant caused the victim to pay 5,267,000 won on his behalf at I located in Geoje City K on the same day, without repaying the amount, thereby acquiring a financial benefit of the same value.",

Moreover, this warranty is not directly connected to specific evidence or facts that the defendant actually used the property received from the victims for personal purposes, such as paying off personal debts and living expenses. Therefore, this warranty appears to be based on assumptions, has weak logical connectivity with the criminal facts, and is insufficient to clearly prove the defendant's actual intentions or actions. For these reasons, w00015 is considered a weak warranty.",
