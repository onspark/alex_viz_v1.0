    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\n\nThe normal bidding process through the National On-Line Procurement System\nThe Public Procurement Service's National On-Line Procurement System (commonly known as 'Nara Market') allows a financial officer of the ordering party (local governments, etc.) to announce facility construction projects by specifying the base amount, adjustment rate (±2% for central government procurement, ±3% for local government procurement), etc. During the bidding period, eligible bidders (construction companies) use a certified bidder's PC to enter their bid amount. They randomly select 2 out of 15 blank spaces, where the estimated price is not displayed, to save those values on the Public Procurement Service server. The financial officer uses a certified financial officer's PC to generate 15 estimated prices within the range of the adjustment rate of the construction base amount, then sends these to the Public Procurement Service server, which shuffles the order of the estimated prices before sending them back to the financial officer's PC. The financial officer encrypts the estimated prices with their certificate and sends them back to the Public Procurement Service server for storage, although this process is not displayed on the financial officer's PC screen.\nWhen the bidding period ends, the system automatically averages the top 4 most selected estimated prices chosen by the bidders to determine the expected construction cost. Then, it calculates the minimum bid price by multiplying the expected construction cost by the bid rate (87.745% for construction costs less than 1 billion, 86.745% for construction costs between 1 billion and less than 3 billion), and finally determines the winning bidder as the one whose bid is closest to the minimum bid price.\n\n1. Defendant A's Crime\nThe defendant, along with AH, AI (both detained and indicted on September 13, 2013), and an unidentified programmer, developed and installed a malicious program for the financial officer's PC (hereinafter referred to as 'financial officer PC malware') that converts the 15 estimated prices (including sequence numbers) generated on the financial officer's PC into specific values based on a certain algorithm using the announcement number, construction base amount, etc. They also developed and installed a malicious program for the bidder's PC (hereinafter referred to as 'bidder PC malware') that manipulates the selection of the 2 estimated price lottery numbers chosen by the bidder (construction company) while entering the bid amount to be transmitted to the Public Procurement Service server from among 4 predetermined numbers, as well as a connection server that automatically connects with the bidder PC malware. They installed the financial officer PC malware on the ordering party's financial officer's PC and the bidder PC malware on the PCs of the bidding managers of the participating construction companies. This manipulation ensured that the 2 estimated price lottery numbers chosen by the bidders were selected from the 4 predetermined numbers on the connection server, and they manipulated the 15 estimated prices (including sequence numbers) on the financial officer's PC to be converted into predetermined values. They then discovered the minimum bid price and informed a specific construction company of the bid amount that would win the bid, illegally securing the construction contract and agreeing to share the proceeds from the successful bid.\nThus, the defendant, in conspiracy with AH, AI, and an unidentified programmer, used the financial officer PC malware distributed and installed around November 2011 to manipulate and store the 15 estimated prices (including sequence numbers) on the financial officer's PC of the ordering party 'AJ' into the Nara Market server. Through the bidder PC malware, they manipulated the selection of the estimated price numbers chosen by the bidder at the time of entering the bid amount to ensure the selection of 4 predetermined estimated prices. They averaged these 4 estimated prices and applied the bid rate to calculate the minimum bid price of 1,942,410,305 won. Then, AL, AH, AI, and others sequentially informed the defendant of the bid amount that could win based on the minimum bid price. The defendant, under the name of AM Co., Ltd., bid with this amount and won the construction contract on around November 21, 2011, for 1,942,412,000 won, which was 1,695 won higher than the minimum bid price.\nAs a result, the defendant, in conspiracy with AI and others, entered and altered information in a computer or other information processing device without authorization, thereby processing information to acquire a financial benefit of 1,942,412,000 won and simultaneously undermining the fairness of the bidding process.\nThe defendant, along with AH and others, conspired from around November 2011 to April 2012 to commit similar acts as listed in the attached crime list (1), entering and altering information in a computer or other information processing device without authorization to process information, thereby acquiring a total financial benefit of 5,221,978,400 won and simultaneously undermining the fairness of the bidding process.\n\n2. Defendant B's Crime\nThe defendant conspired with AH and an unidentified programmer in the same manner as described in item 1 to ensure that his construction company would receive illegal bids in sequence.\nThus, the defendant, along with AH and an unidentified programmer, used the financial officer PC malware distributed and installed around July 2012 to manipulate and store the 15 estimated prices (including sequence numbers) on the financial officer's PC of the ordering party 'AN' into the Nara Market server. Through the bidder PC malware, they manipulated the selection of the estimated price numbers chosen by the bidder at the time of entering the bid amount to ensure the selection of 4 predetermined estimated prices. They averaged these 4 estimated prices and applied the bid rate to calculate the minimum bid price of 2,857,627,979 won. Then, AL, AH, and others sequentially informed the defendant of the bid amount that could win based on the minimum bid price. The defendant, under the name of AP Co., Ltd., bid with this amount and won the construction contract on July 11, 2012, for 2,857,629,000 won, which was 1,021 won higher than the minimum bid price.\nAs a result, the defendant, in conspiracy with AH and others, entered and altered information in a computer or other information processing device without authorization, thereby processing information to acquire a financial benefit of 2,857,629,000 won and simultaneously undermining the fairness of the bidding process.\nThe defendant, along with AH and others, conspired from around July 2012 to October 2012 to commit similar acts as listed in the attached crime list (2), entering and altering information in a computer or other information processing device without authorization to process information, thereby acquiring a total financial benefit of 6,717,725,000 won and simultaneously undermining the fairness of the bidding process.\n\n3. Defendant C's Crime\nThe defendant conspired with AH and an unidentified programmer in the same manner as described in item 1 to ensure that his construction company would receive illegal bids in sequence.\nThus, the defendant, along with AH and an unidentified programmer, used the financial officer PC malware distributed and installed around October 2011 to manipulate and store the 15 estimated prices (including sequence numbers) on the financial officer's PC of the ordering party 'AQ' into the Nara Market server. Through the bidder PC malware, they manipulated the selection of the estimated price numbers chosen by the bidder at the time of entering the bid amount to ensure the selection of 4 predetermined estimated prices. They averaged these 4 estimated prices and applied the bid rate to calculate the minimum bid price of 419,602,250 won. Then, AL, AH, and others sequentially informed the defendant of the bid amount that could win based on the minimum bid price. The defendant, under the name of AS Co., Ltd., bid with this amount and won the construction contract on October 4, 2011, for 419,603,000 won, which was 750 won higher than the minimum bid price.\nAs a result, the defendant, in conspiracy with AH and others, entered and altered information in a computer or other information processing device without authorization, thereby processing information to acquire a financial benefit of 419,603,000 won and simultaneously undermining the fairness of the bidding process.\nThe defendant, along with AH and others, conspired from around October 2011 to May 2012 to commit similar acts as listed in the attached crime list (3), entering and altering information in a computer or other information processing device without authorization to process information, thereby acquiring a total financial benefit of 3,668,439,400 won and simultaneously undermining the fairness of the bidding process.\n\n4.

This setup manipulated and altered the system so that the two example lottery numbers selected by the bidders while entering their bid amounts were chosen from the four pre-determined example lottery numbers on the connection server. By manipulating and altering the 15 examples (including sequence numbers) on the finance manager's PC into pre-determined specific values, the defendant discovered the minimum bid price that would win the bid. Then, the defendant informed a specific construction company of the bid amount that would win the bid, enabling the company to illegally win the construction contract. Subsequently, the defendant planned to receive and share the proceeds from the winning bid with that construction company.\"",
