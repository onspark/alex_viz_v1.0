    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\n\nThe defendants are internal directors of Company E located in C, D-dong, Gijang-gun, Busan (the company name was changed to Company F around June 4, 2020), and the victim G is the representative of a limited company I, which is engaged in the construction business in H, Mokpo city. Defendant A, knowing that Company E was struggling financially and also experiencing personal financial difficulties due to personal debts, proposed to Defendant B, who was close to the victim, to borrow money from the victim under the pretext that the company urgently needed funds for construction. Defendant B, also burdened with personal debts borrowed from acquaintances, agreed to Defendant A's proposal to conspire together to embezzle funds from the victim.\n\nSubsequently, around mid-February 2020, Defendant B proposed to the victim, \"Can you subcontract and complete the construction of a 2,000 pyeong (approx. 6,611 square meters) new factory building project in Hamyang-gun, ordered by Company J, from Company E?\" When the victim visited the construction site in Hamyang-gun but decided not to contract due to a shortage of steel materials, the defendants at the site persuaded the victim to sign the contract by saying, \"We will adjust and provide the lacking materials later.\" Eventually, the victim contracted to subcontract the steel structure construction of the new factory in Hamyang-gun ordered by Company J from Company E, with a total construction cost of 957 million won, an advance payment of 190 million won, and a construction period from March 2, 2020, to July 31, 2020.\n\nUpon the victim entering into the subcontract agreement, the defendants immediately lied to the victim, saying, \"Our company urgently needs money for another construction site, so if you receive the advance payment of 190 million won, please lend us 150 million won. Our company has enough money, so we can repay it at any time. We will definitely repay it within two months at the latest.\" However, the defendants had no intention or ability to repay the borrowed money to the victim, as they planned to use the funds for their personal debt repayment rather than for Company E's other construction sites. They had personal debts of tens of millions of won borrowed from acquaintances, and with Company E's deteriorating management, there was no significant income.\n\nDespite this, the defendants deceived the victim and received a total of 150 million won, including 100 million won around March 5, 2020, and 50 million won around March 6, 2020, into Defendant B's K Bank account from the victim who was tricked by their deceit.\n\nThus, the defendants conspired to receive property from the victim.",

The claim that \"it is realistically impossible to take out a large loan without any property or income\" does not apply to all cases, especially without considering specific circumstances such as the lending criteria of financial institutions or the credit status of the defendant. Therefore, this guarantee is considered weak in terms of logical connection in reflecting the actual intent of the defendant and lacks direct relevance to the criminal facts. For these reasons, w00012 is considered a weak guarantee.",
