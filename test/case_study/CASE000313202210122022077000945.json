    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\n[Criminal Record]\nThe defendant was sentenced to one year in prison for violating the Electronic Financial Transactions Act by the Incheon District Court on April 15, 2022, and the judgment became final on April 26, 2022.\n[Crime Facts]\nThe mastermind of a voice phishing (commonly known as 'voice phishing') organization, whose name is unknown, organized various stages including deception, management, and delivery, and members of the organization involved in deception randomly called an unspecified number of victims, pretending to be financial institutions, etc., and lied to them, causing the deceived victims to hand over the money. The manager recruited cash collectors, deliverers, and withdrawers, the collectors handed over the collected cash to the deliverers, the deliverers then transferred it to another deliverer or sent it to an account directed by the manager, and the withdrawers used a check card linked to the account that received the transferred victim's money to withdraw the money through an ATM and deposit it into an account designated by the unknown person by non-face-to-face deposit.\nThe defendant conspired to act as a cash withdrawer upon receiving such instructions from a member of the voice phishing organization.\nAccording to such conspiracy, an unknown person impersonated victim B's child around 20:00 on November 16, 2021, at an unknown place and sent a KakaoTalk message to the victim saying, \"Dad, I lost my phone. To receive compensation for the lost phone, you need to enter the authentication number, but I don't have a phone right now, so please receive it for me. You need to access the site being sent,\" causing the victim to access an unknown site, then installing an application that could remotely control the mobile phone, and after receiving a photo of the victim's ID, the account number of the victim's name, password, etc., used them to transfer 6,020,000 won from the victim's C bank account (account number 1 omitted) to D's E bank account (account number 2 omitted) and from then until around 00:45 on November 17, 2021, a total of 7 unauthorized information entries were made to transfer a total of 42,210,000 won as listed in the attached crime list (1).\nMeanwhile, according to such conspiracy, following the instructions of the unknown person, the defendant withdrew 1,000,450 won from G bank Unju station branch in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, around 22:35 on November 16, 2021, and from then until around 01:19 on November 17, 2021, a total of 15 withdrawals were made to withdraw a total of 14,992,700 won as listed in the attached crime list (2) and then deposited it into an account designated by the unknown person by non-face-to-face deposit.\nThus, the defendant, in conspiracy with the unknown person, by entering information without authorization into a computer or other information processing device to process information, thereby acquired a property benefit totaling 42,210,000 won.",

However, the weakness of this claim lies in the fact that performing a specific role in consultation with a criminal organization and agreeing to share the profits does not necessarily mean voluntary criminal conspiracy. The mere fact that the defendant received and accepted an offer is insufficient to prove the defendant's voluntariness. Especially considering the systematic structure and role allocation of the telephone financial fraud organization, it is difficult to see the defendant acting independently without the organization's instructions. Therefore, this claim lacks logical coherence and relevance to the criminal facts.",
