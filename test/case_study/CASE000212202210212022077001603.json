    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\n\nThe organization behind telephone financial fraud (commonly known as 'voice phishing') operates from foreign countries such as China, deceiving an unspecified number of victims within the country by impersonating financial institutions or investigative agencies over the phone, and embezzling money from those who are tricked into handing it over. The operation is divided into roles such as the 'mastermind' who oversees the entire operation and manages organic communication between internal cells, the 'manager' who follows the mastermind's orders to oversee internal members and instructs them on deception techniques and cash collection methods, the 'call center member' who calls victims impersonating financial institutions or investigative agencies to deceive them, and the 'cash collector' who meets with victims in person to receive the money.\n\nThe defendant, around the end of October 2021, conspired sequentially with members of an unidentified voice phishing organization after receiving a proposal from an unidentified member of the organization to act as a 'cash collector' under the direction of an unidentified person via KakaoTalk mobile messenger, to personally collect the defrauded money from victims and deliver it to the unidentified person, in exchange for a fee.\n\n1. Theft\nAn unidentified person, around November 4, 2021, impersonated 'Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency D' and called victim C (female, 82 years old), claiming \"Your name has been used for international calls. Money amounting to tens of millions of won could be withdrawn from your account, so you must cancel your deposit account and withdraw all the cash.\" Subsequently, another unidentified person impersonated 'Financial Supervisory Service E Manager' and advised over the phone \"All the people who touched the cash must be fingerprinted, so put all the withdrawn cash in a black plastic bag and leave it under the mailbox in front of your house. After fingerprinting, we will return the cash in person or transfer it back to your account.\"\n\nHowever, these unidentified individuals were not employees of any investigative agency or financial institution, and had no intention of returning the cash taken under the pretext of 'fingerprinting'.\n\nDespite this, by deceiving the victim in such a manner, they made the victim leave 48 million won in cash inside a black plastic bag under the mailbox of her home in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, around 13:00 on November 4, 2021. Following their instructions, the defendant secretly took the cash at the specified time and place and later met with another unidentified member of the organization at an unknown location to hand over the cash.\n\nThus, the defendant, in conspiracy with the unidentified individuals, embezzled 48 million won in cash owned by the victim.\n\n2. Fraud\nAn unidentified person, around 09:50 on November 4, 2021, from an unknown location, called victim B (male, 83 years old) impersonating 'Financial Supervisory Service G', falsely claiming \"A bank employee has been using bank money for personal use and luxury. We are trying to find that bank employee who used your money for personal purposes. Withdraw all the money from your bank account and hand it over to the employee we send, and we will fingerprint the money and return it to you.\"\n\nHowever, in reality, the unidentified person was not an employee of the Financial Supervisory Service, and had no intention of returning the money received from the victim.\n\nNevertheless, by deceiving the victim in such a manner, they made the victim prepare and wait with 35 million won in cash inside room I of H Motel in Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul, around 15:50 on November 4, 2021. Following their instructions, the defendant received the cash from the victim at the specified time and place and later met with another unidentified member of the organization at an unknown location to hand over the cash.\n\nThus, the defendant, in conspiracy with the unidentified individuals, deceived the victim and embezzled 35 million won in cash owned by the victim.",

Legal responsibility relies more on their actions and objective contribution to the crime than on their subjective perception.
