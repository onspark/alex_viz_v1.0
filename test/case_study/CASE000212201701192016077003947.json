    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\nThe defendant was sentenced to 1 year in prison and 2 years of suspended execution by the Incheon District Court, Bucheon Branch, on April 24, 2015, for fraud, etc., and the judgment became final on May 2, 2015.\nThe defendant is a domestic cash withdrawal agent connected to a so-called phishing fraud organization linked with Chinese individuals.\nIn conspiracy with unidentified members of the phishing organization (alias 'D'), the defendant used fake websites and internet access programs of domestic financial institutions created by the phishing organization members through unknown methods to obtain victims' financial information. Then, by transferring the victims' money to a predetermined account, the defendant, possessing the check card linked to the account where the money was transferred, was instructed by 'D' to withdraw the money in cash and transfer it to another predetermined account.\nAn unidentified member of the phishing organization spread malware capable of accessing fake financial institution websites, creating personal information input fields related to financial fraud, and acquiring the financial information entered by victims, through unknown methods in an unspecified location in China around 2014. This malware infected a computer installed at the office of Company G, located in Seobuk-gu, Cheonan-si, Chungcheongnam-do, with victim F as its representative.\nOn September 24, 2014, around 17:18, the company's accountant H, unaware of the malware infection on the office computer, accessed the KB Kookmin Bank internet banking site using the computer. A popup window appeared, unusually prompting to register for a \"Financial Information Leakage Secondary Damage Prevention Service.\" Believing it to be a normal procedure of the financial institution, H entered the financial information of Company G, including the Kookmin Bank account number, account password, transfer password, and digital certificate password, and similarly entered the financial information of the company's NH Bank account.\nUsing the financial information of Company G entered by H, who was deceived by the fake site on September 24, 2014, around 17:18, the unidentified member of the phishing organization transferred 268,000,000 won stored in Company G's Kookmin Bank account (account number I) and NH Bank account (account number J) into 13,000,000 won to a Saemaul Geumgo account under the name of K (account number L), 30,000,000 won to a Shinhan Bank account under the name of M (account number N), another 30,000,000 won to a different Shinhan Bank account under the name of M (account number O), 30,000,000 won to a Post Office account under the name of P (account number Q), and continued on September 25, 2014, around 08:40, transferring 30,000,000 won to a Hana Daetoo Securities account under the name of R (account number S), 20,000,000 won to a Hana Daetoo Securities account under the name of T (account number U), 20,000,000 won to a Dongyang Securities account under the name of T (account number V), 10,000,000 won to a Dongbu Securities account under the name of T (account number W), 20,000,000 won to an IBK account under the name of X (account number Y), 20,000,000 won to a Shinhyup account under the name of Z (account number AA), 20,000,000 won to an IBK account under the name of AB (account number AC), and 25,000,000 won to a Kookmin Bank account under the name of AD (account number AE).\nSubsequently, the defendant, using the check card of the Shinhan Bank account under the name of M, which he had in possession, withdrew a total of 25,564,600 won from around September 24 to 25, 2014, and transferred it to a person or account as instructed by 'D'.\nThus, the defendant facilitated the acquisition of a property benefit amounting to 25,564,600 won by aiding 'D' and others in unauthorizedly entering and altering information in computers and other information processing devices, thereby facilitating their information processing.",
