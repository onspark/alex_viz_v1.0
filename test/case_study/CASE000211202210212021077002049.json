    "crime_fact": "Criminal Facts\n\"2021고단2049\"\n1. Fraud against victim C\nThe defendant, from around September 1, 2020, had been tutoring a high school student, victim C, whom they met through a tutoring app, in subjects such as Korean, English, and Mathematics.\nAround December 16, 2020, the defendant told the victim that if they were given money for textbooks for Korean and English subjects, they would purchase the textbooks for them. However, in reality, the defendant intended to use the money received under the pretext of textbook fees for online gambling or living expenses, without any intention or ability to purchase textbooks for the victim.\nBy deceiving the victim in this manner, the defendant received a total of 15,014,000 won from the victim into their E bank account in the name of the defendant, including 154,000 won on the same day, through a total of 12 instances of deception from that time until around February 21, 2021, as listed in the attached crime summary table.\n2. Fraud against victim F\nAround February 21, 2021, the defendant, having met victim F through a part-time job, told them, \"I urgently need money due to a traffic accident. I will borrow it and pay you back as soon as I receive my salary the day after tomorrow.\" However, in reality, there was no traffic accident, the defendant had no salary to receive, and intended to use the borrowed money to repay other debts. Thus, they had no intention or ability to repay the money to the victim in a short period. By deceiving the victim in this manner, the defendant received 2,000,000 won from the victim into their E bank account in the name of the defendant on the same day.\n\"2021고단3019\"\nOn March 19, 2021, around 15:14, at the defendant's residence in H, I-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul, the defendant accessed the internet J site, posted an advertisement for the sale of an LG Gram laptop, and deceived the victim B, who contacted them after seeing the advertisement, into thinking they were capable of selling the item normally, despite having no ability or intention to do so, and received 700,000 won as payment into their E bank account in the name of the defendant on the same day.\n\"2022고단745\"\nAround September 12, 2021, 00:00, at an unspecified motel in Gwanak-gu, Seoul, the defendant lied to victim D, saying, \"I want to buy shoes on the internet K, but I need 250,000 won to buy them. I will receive 1,000,000 won as tutoring fees around 07:00 on September 12, and I will pay you back as soon as I receive it.\" However, in reality, the defendant intended to use the borrowed money for online gambling and was not in a situation to receive tutoring fees that morning, living without a residence and having no particular income at the time. Despite this, the defendant deceived the victim and received 50,000 won into their L account (account number omitted) at 00:46 on the same day, and another 200,000 won into the same account at 02:34, embezzling the money.\n\"2022고단1535\"\n1. Crime against victim M\na. Fraud\nAround July 19, 2021, at the N Gangnam main branch in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, the defendant lied to the victim, saying, \"I am running a startup program-related business, and you can buy a computer worth 3 million won cheaply using the government support funds received by the company I operate. Please send me 500,000 won first for the purchase of the computer.\" However, in reality, the defendant was not running any business at the time, and the story about government support funds was entirely false. The defendant had personal debts exceeding 80 million won and was in a very poor financial state, intending to use the money received from the victim for online gambling.\nThe defendant deceived the victim in this manner and received 500,000 won into their 0 account at 21:40 on July 19, 2021, and from that time until around August 17, 2021, embezzled a total of 72,100,000 won in 8 instances as listed in the attached crime summary table 1.\nb. Fraud using a computer or similar device\nAround July 21, 2021, in an unspecified location in Seoul, the defendant lied to the victim over the phone, saying, \"The computer purchase cost must be charged to the victim's name to receive government support. If you make the payment, I will repay you with the government support funds next month,\" and obtained the victim's card information, including card number, password, and expiration date. However, in reality, the defendant intended to make card payments using the victim's card information and receive 80% of the payment amount deposited into their account from an unnamed card cashing broker.\nThus, the defendant entered the victim's card information on their mobile phone at 16:57 on July 21, 2021, made a payment of 2,997,000 won, and caused an unnamed card cashing broker to acquire property benefits amounting to the same, among other instances between that time and 18:56 on August 10, 2021, as listed in the attached crime summary table 2, by entering information into a computer or similar information processing device without authorization, causing a total of 17,842,000 won in property benefits to be acquired by the so-called card cashing broker.\n2. Crime against victim P\nAround August 25, 2021, in an unspecified location in Seoul, the defendant lied to the victim over the phone, saying, \"My coworker M is involved in a loan scam and has defaulted on a card payment. I urgently need money to help M. I will borrow it and pay you back soon.\" However, in reality, M had not been involved in any voice phishing or loan scam but had been defrauded by the defendant. The defendant had personal debts exceeding 80 million won and was in a very poor financial state, intending to use the borrowed money not to help M but for online gambling.\nThe defendant deceived the victim in this manner and received 500,000 won into their L account (account number omitted) at 20:46 on the same day, and from that time until 21:25 on September 2, 2021, embezzled a total of 4,500,000 won in 4 instances as listed in the attached crime summary table 3.\n3. Crime against victim Q\nAround August 26, 2021, in an unspecified location in Seoul, the defendant lied to the victim over the phone, saying, \"My coworker M is involved in a loan scam and needs help, but I am short on money. If you lend me the money, I will pass it on to M to help, and I will repay you as soon as the issue is resolved.\" However, in reality, M had not been involved in any voice phishing or loan scam but had been defrauded by the defendant. The defendant had personal debts exceeding 80 million won and was in a very poor financial state, intending to use the borrowed money not to help M but for online gambling.\nThe defendant deceived the victim in this manner and received 4,200,000 won into their 0 account at 16:57 on the same day, and from that time until 15:25 on August 27, 2021, embezzled a total of 8,400,000 won in 2 instances as listed in the attached crime summary table 4, and by entering information into a computer or similar information processing device without authorization, caused an unnamed card cashing broker to acquire property benefits amounting to 4,499,000 won.\n4. Crime against victim R\nAround October 3, 2021, near S in Jung-gu, Seoul, at an unspecified café, the defendant lied to the victim, saying, \"I am running a business, but I am short on funds needed for the business. If you lend me some money temporarily, I will use it for business-related expenses and repay you soon.\" However, in reality, the defendant was not running any business at the time, had personal debts exceeding 80 million won, and was in a very poor financial state, living without a residence and engaging in online gambling without any particular income. Thus, they intended to use the borrowed money for online gambling.\nThe defendant deceived the victim in this manner and received 704,600 won into their 0 securities account (account number omitted) at 14:27 on the same day, and from that time until 19:35 on October 9, 2021, embezzled a total of 6,292,994 won in 11 instances as listed in the attached crime summary table 5.",
