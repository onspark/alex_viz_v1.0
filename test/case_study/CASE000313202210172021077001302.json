    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\nCase Number: 2021고단1302\nThe mastermind of a voice phishing (hereinafter referred to as 'voice phishing') criminal organization, whose name is unknown, organized various stages such as recruiters, managers, baiters, and cash collectors to commit voice phishing crimes. A member of the organization belonging to the recruiters recruited cash collectors and withdrawers who could operate domestically, connected them to the managers, and a member of the organization belonging to the managers functionally managed the voice phishing members by instructing them on specific criminal acts. Members of the organization belonging to the baiters randomly called victims, pretending to be financial institutions offering loans or impersonating investigative agencies claiming the need to verify identity theft, thus deceiving the victims into withdrawing cash and delivering it to the cash collectors impersonating employees of financial institutions. The cash collectors, pretending to be employees of financial institutions in front of the deceived victims, presented forged documents from the Financial Supervisory Service or financial institutions, and transferred the money received from the victims to an account directed by the voice phishing manager according to their respective roles, thereby conspiring to commit the crime.\nThe defendant was proposed by an unknown voice phishing member (alias 'AD') around April 2021 to take on the role of a cash collector, meeting the victims in person, collecting the defrauded money, and transferring it to a designated account without a bankbook. In relation to this, the defendant received specific precautions from 'AD', such as \"Use only cash for all expenses, do not use your own vehicle when moving, and if a bank employee asks when depositing money in someone else's name, notify immediately,\" thereby sequentially conspiring with the unknown voice phishing members to commit fraud.\nAn unknown person acting as a baiter for voice phishing sent a loan advertisement text message to victim AC around 08:40 on April 13, 2021. When the victim called back, despite having no intention or ability to provide a loan, the person impersonated an employee of AE Bank to induce the victim to apply for a loan. Another unknown baiter, impersonating an AF employee, called the victim and lied, saying, \"Applying for an additional loan is a breach of contract, so if you do not repay the existing loan within 24 hours, you will have to pay more than double,\" and \"An AF employee will be sent, so deliver the existing loan amount of 30.2 million won.\"\nThe aforementioned unknown persons deceived the victim in this manner, and following 'AD's instructions, the defendant met the victim around 18:10 on April 13, 2021, in front of AH restaurant operated by the victim in Cheongsong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and received a black plastic bag containing 30.2 million won in cash.\nThus, the defendant, in sequential conspiracy with the unknown voice phishing members, deceived the victim and received 30.2 million won from the victim.\nCase Number: 2022고단926\n1. Insult, Assault\nThe defendant was a customer visiting AJ Mart in Gimcheon City, and the victim AK (male, 38 years old) was working as the head of the security team at the mart.\na. Insult\nAround 17:05 on April 25, 2022, in front of the information desk on the first floor of AJ Mart, while making noise with an electronic whistle, the defendant was asked by the victim to stop the noise. In response, in front of many other employees and customers of the mart, the defendant loudly said, \"Hey, you pervert bastard, what are you looking at?\"\nThus, the defendant publicly insulted the victim.\nb. Assault\nAt the same time and place as item a., believing that the victim was staring at his chest, the defendant became angry and said to the victim, \"I'll gouge your eyes out,\" threatening to poke the victim's eyes by bringing two fingers close to the victim's face, and acted as if he was going to kick the victim with his knee.\nThus, the defendant assaulted the victim.\n2. Obstruction of Business\nFrom 12:18 to 12:23 on May 17, 2022, in the AJ Mart's first-floor store as described in item 1, without any particular reason, the defendant suddenly shouted at the victim AL, who was working as a mart employee, thrust an electronic whistle in AL's face while making a loud noise with the whistle, and continued to make noise. Despite being told by another mart employee, victim AM, who was arranging bottled water nearby, \"Please wait, move aside, you'll get hurt,\" the defendant did not move aside and continued to thrust the electronic whistle in AM's face and make loud noises, and when AM protested, the defendant shouted, causing a disturbance for about 5 minutes.\nThus, the defendant obstructed the mart employees' store management and customer service work by force.",

Indirectly proving awareness and agreement to the crime is a weaker basis than directly proving the intent of the crime. Moreover, the mere fact that the defendant participated in the crime is not sufficient to prove implied intent.
