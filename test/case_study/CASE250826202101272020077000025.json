    "crime_fact": "<translated text>\n\nCrime Details\nThe defendant, on July 13, 2019, in Siheung City, Building B, Unit C, received a proposal from an unidentified member of a voice phishing organization using the WeChat ID 'D', which impersonated a 'luxury goods purchasing agent' business. The proposal stated, 'It involves working from home. If you provide your bank account number, money will be deposited into it. After withdrawing the money, contact us, and you will meet with an employee sent by the company. You must then travel together to E in Seoul, exchange the money for gift vouchers, and hand over the vouchers to the employee. For each transaction, you will receive a commission of 150,000 won.' Knowing that the defendant's bank account would be used for illegal activities such as voice phishing, the defendant, desiring to gain financial benefit, agreed to this and provided their F account number (account number 1 omitted) to the unidentified individual, thereby allowing the account to be used in the crime. The defendant decided to follow the instructions of the unidentified individual by purchasing gift vouchers in cash and delivering them.\n\nMeanwhile, the unidentified member of the voice phishing organization, on or around July 12, 2019, from an unknown location, sent a text message to the victim G stating, '800 dollars have been charged overseas.' After receiving the text message and calling back, the victim was told, 'If you haven't made any overseas transactions, it seems like your information has been stolen. I will report it to the police.' Pretending to be a police officer, the scammer then called the victim and said, 'Your identity has been stolen, and an H bank account has been opened in your name, which seems to have been used in a crime. Install the H application on your mobile phone, issue a digital certificate, enter the digital certificate password, and transfer the money from other accounts to H.' By lying in this manner, the scammer tricked the victim into installing a hacking program on the victim's mobile phone.\n\nUsing the application, the unidentified individual remotely manipulated the victim's mobile phone on July 15, 2019, around 15:09, accessed H, and without authorization, entered the OTP number obtained from the victim, transferring 30 million won to the defendant's aforementioned F account.\n\nThus, by providing the account number to receive the stolen funds to the unidentified individual, the defendant facilitated the unidentified individual's computer fraud crime by aiding and abetting.",

However, this argument does not directly prove that the defendant was sufficiently aware of the collusion through the acts demonstrated in the specific execution process of the crime. Whether the defendant was aware of collusion with the criminal organization pertains to his internal state, which may be difficult to clearly determine based solely on external actions. Therefore, the basis of this argument is merely hypothetical, and such assumptions cannot be universally accepted or applied in all cases, making w00015's argument weakly founded.",
