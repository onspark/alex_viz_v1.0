Attempted Extortion\nAround 12:47 PM on November 6, 2017, in the defendant's office located in Gangbuk-gu, Seoul, the defendant called the victim D (female, 62 years old) and demanded 20 million won for attorney fees, claiming \"I need money for the lawyer's fees for the case I'm being tried for.\" When the victim refused, the defendant threatened her by saying, \"You bitch, you damn woman, if you don't give me the money, I'll pour thinner on your face,\" attempting to extort money. However, the victim reported this to the police, and the defendant's attempt was unsuccessful.\n2. Violation of the Act on Aggravated Punishment, etc. of Specific Crimes (Threat of Retaliation, etc.)\nAround 2:40 PM on November 6, 2017, the defendant went to 'F Hospital' in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, where the victim's husband was hospitalized, and threatened the victim by saying, \"I will slit your throat,\" because she had reported the attempted extortion to the police.\nThus, the defendant threatened the victim D, who had reported him, with the purpose of retaliation related to his criminal case.\n「2018고합52」\nAround November 12, 2013, at a coffee shop in front of exit 1 of H station on line 6 in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, the defendant lied to the victim I, saying, \"If you buy a dishonored bill, I can deposit 10 billion won into a bank account and create a balance certificate for 10 billion won. I need 20 million won as a fee.\" \nHowever, it was impossible to create a bank account balance certificate with 10 billion won through a dishonored bill, and the defendant intended to use the money at a racetrack or similar places, despite receiving it under the guise of a fee.\nNevertheless, the defendant deceived the victim and received 5 million won in cash on the same day, and also received a Shinhan Bank account (account number: K) under the name J from the victim, withdrawing 5 million won (five 1 million won bank checks) from the account around November 15, 2013, and received a passbook containing 5 million won in cash under the name J from the victim around November 21, 2013.\nThus, the defendant deceived the victim and embezzled a total of 15 million won.",

The mere fact of having a prior record does not conclusively prove the defendant's level of awareness or intent.
