    "crime_fact": "Crime Fact 1)\nThe defendant is the actual operator of 'B', a packaging material manufacturing company, and C is the actual operator of D Co., Ltd., a plastic bag printing machine manufacturing company (hereinafter referred to as 'D').\nThe defendant borrowed and used a bill of exchange issued by D worth 55,130,000 won (with a maturity date of February 28, 2020, hereinafter referred to as 'the bill in question') around October 17, 2019, and accordingly had an obligation to pay the bill amount to D by the maturity date. However, due to a lack of funds, the defendant was unable to pay the bill amount and faced a situation where payment could not be made.\nIn this situation, around February 28, 2020, the defendant lied to the victim E, saying, \"I am in a situation where I cannot pay the bill amount, so please lend me 50 million won. I have delivered goods, but the payment for the goods was made by card and the money has not yet been deposited into the account. The card approval will be completed within 10 days, and I will immediately repay the borrowed money.\" The defendant then had C send photos of two sales slips of B (total sales amount of 30 million won) to the victim.\nHowever, the two sales slips sent to the victim by the defendant were not card sales slips but cash sales slips for which the payment for the goods had already been received. The defendant, having numerous debts and being in poor financial condition, had neither the intention nor the ability to repay the borrowed money even if it was borrowed from the victim.\nThe defendant, by deceiving the victim in this manner, fraudulently obtained a transfer of 50 million won from the victim, who was deceived by the defendant, into the Woori Bank account under the name of D (account number omitted) on the same day.",

However, the evidence and warrant provided indicate that the defendant acted alone, with no mention or evidence of an accomplice. This represents a weak logical connection, and the mention of an accomplice is deemed the weakest argument since it is not directly related to the facts of the case. Mentioning an accomplice solely based on the defendant's actions, without any specific evidence or explanation of the situation, amounts to a baseless assumption.",
