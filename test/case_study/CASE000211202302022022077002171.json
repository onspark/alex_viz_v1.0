    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\nThe defendant and the victim B were middle school classmates.\n1. Fraud under the pretext of purchasing C Corporation stocks\nAround March 2018, in the victim's office located in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, the defendant lied to the victim, saying, \"Buy stocks of C Corporation. It is a company scheduled to be listed on NASDAQ around June 2018, and once it is listed, you can make a profit of tens of times more. I also own hundreds of thousands of shares of this company. I have secured 50,000 shares of C Corporation, each with a face value of 1 dollar, so you can either purchase 20,000 shares for 22 million won or 50,000 shares for 55 million won.\"\nHowever, in reality, C was not a corporation and there was no plan to list it on NASDAQ around June 2018. The defendant did not own shares of the said company but instead owned coins issued by a company 'E', and even if the defendant received money from the victim under the pretext of purchasing stocks, the defendant intended to use it for personal credit card payments, personal debt repayments, etc., and could not purchase the promised NASDAQ-listed stocks or generate profits for the victim.\nNevertheless, the defendant deceived the victim in this manner and embezzled 22 million won deposited into the defendant's F bank account (account number omitted) by the victim, who was deceived, on April 23, 2018.\n2. Fraud related to G\nAround August 2018, at the same location as in the first clause, the defendant lied to the victim, saying, \"I own G coins worth tens of billions of won by investing about 600 million won in a comprehensive shopping mall company called G. Since I have the right to receive 5 times the coins when purchasing goods from G, if you lend me 50 million won, I will invest it in G and increase it several times by October 2018. Even if G does not generate profits, I will take responsibility and return the principal in full.\"\nHowever, in reality, G was in a state where actual business operations were not properly conducted due to several delays in the opening of the shopping mall, and the business outlook was uncertain as H, the representative of the corporation running the G business, was detained and undergoing trial for fraud, among other charges. The defendant, well aware of G's situation, knew that it was highly unlikely for the G business to proceed properly and that it was impossible to guarantee profits or return the principal to the victim. The defendant, having no steady income at the time, intended to use the 50 million won received from the victim not only for investing in G but also for personal living expenses and debt repayments, and had neither the intention nor the ability to return the profits or principal as promised.\nNevertheless, the defendant deceived the victim in this manner and embezzled 50 million won transferred to the defendant's F account (account number omitted) by the victim, who was deceived, on August 14, 2018.",

Therefore, this guarantee is considered weak due to its weak logical connection to the criminal facts and the lack of widespread consensus on the assumption that past behavior determines current behavior.",
