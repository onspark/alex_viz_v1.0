    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\n[Criminal Record]\nThe defendant was sentenced to six months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence by the Seoul Southern District Court on September 16, 2020, for violating the Attorney-at-Law Act, and the judgment became final on October 7, 2021.\n[2021고단3406]\nAround April 27, 2020, in a certified real estate agent's office located in Gangseo-gu, Seoul, the defendant lied to the victim B, saying, \"If son E joins F, there will be support from Gangwon-do Taebaek City, G, etc., but a corporation must be established to receive the support funds, and it is possible to pay salaries to employed players and coaches. If you transfer 20 million won to open a corporate account for balance certification purposes, I will repay the money as soon as the corporate approval is completed.\"\nHowever, in reality, the defendant was operating F and was burdened with a debt of about 45 million won to a baseball equipment supplier at the time, and was unable to pay the baseball team's coach for six months, making it impossible to operate the baseball team normally. The defendant was also burdened with a debt of 13 million won during the baseball team's establishment process, intending to use the money received from the victim for debt repayment, living expenses, and other personal purposes, without the intention or ability to repay the victim within the agreed period.\nEventually, the defendant deceived the victim in this manner and received 20 million won on the same day into the defendant's H cooperative account (account number omitted) under the pretext of corporate account opening expenses.\n[2021고단5138]\nSince around November 2018, despite being in personal rehabilitation and lacking the financial ability to operate an amateur baseball team, the defendant established a corporation 'F' to participate in the amateur baseball league around May 4, 2020, and started operating the baseball team as the representative and manager of 'F', responsible for fundraising, with a plan to rely solely on external sponsorships and donations without any basic assets of the baseball team or funds directly contributed by the defendant.\n1. Crime against victim I\nAround June 2020, at a restaurant operated by victim I inside J Pension in Taebaek City, Gangwon-do, the defendant told the victim, \"From June 9, 2020, to October 31, 2020, and from March 1, 2021, to October 31, 2021, F and other visiting baseball teams belonging to the amateur baseball league will use J Pension as accommodation and have their meals at J Pension's restaurant. If one team comes, it will be 20-25 people, and since they play games in Taebaek two to three days a week, you can make quite a lot of money. I will pay for F's lodging and meals, and you can earn more income than that from the restaurant revenue, so please provide 10 million won as a donation and provide lodging and meals for F.\"\nHowever, at that time, 'F' Corporation had no other assets except for about 50,000 won in the account balance, and the defendant, being in personal rehabilitation, had no assets but only debts. The defendant hoped for support funds from K Association, L Sports Council, M Social Contribution Team, etc., for 'F', but it was uncertain whether the support funds would be provided. With the spread of COVID-19, the operation of the amateur baseball league itself was uncertain, and it was impossible to secure other sponsorship funds. Even if other visiting teams came to Taebaek City for the league, the accommodation for the visiting teams was determined by the teams themselves, not arbitrarily by the defendant, so the defendant had neither the intention nor the ability to pay for 'F's lodging and meals and to earn revenue from the lodging of the visiting teams for the victim.\nNevertheless, the defendant lied to the victim in this manner and received a total of 10,000,000 won transferred to the defendant's N cooperative account (account number omitted) under the pretext of donations on June 1, 2020, 7,000,000 won, and on June 7, 3,000,000 won, and received lodging and meals for 'F' worth a total of 8,937,000 won, including meal expenses of 8,750,000 won, beverage and liquor expenses of 87,000 won, and delivery fuel costs of 100,000 won, from around June 9 to July 10, 2020.\nAs a result, the defendant deceived the victim and embezzled 10,000,000 won worth of property and gained property benefits worth 8,937,000 won.\n2. Crime against victim O\nAround July 12, 2020, at 'Q Restaurant' operated by victim O in Taebaek City, Gangwon-do, through 'F's bus driver R, the defendant told the victim, \"If you provide three meals a day to the baseball team players, we will settle twice a month, and use four rooms on the second floor of the same rest area from July 15 to August 31, 2020, and pay the accommodation fee of 4.8 million won by July 31.\"\nHowever, at that time, 'F' Corporation had no other assets except for about 70,000 won in the account balance, and the defendant, being in personal rehabilitation, had no assets but only debts. The defendant hoped for support funds from K Association, L Sports Council, M Social Contribution Team, etc., for 'F', but it was uncertain whether the support funds would be provided. With the spread of COVID-19, the operation of the amateur baseball league itself was uncertain, making it impossible to secure other sponsorship funds, so the defendant had neither the intention nor the ability to pay for 'F's lodging and meals for the victim.\nNevertheless, the defendant lied to the victim in this manner and received lodging and meals for 'F' worth a total of 7,672,000 won, including meal expenses of 2,872,000 won and accommodation expenses of 4,800,000 won, from July 12 to July 28, 2020.\nAs a result, the defendant deceived the victim and embezzled property benefits worth a total of 7,672,000 won.",

Concluding that the defendant lacked the intention or capability for business progression, based solely on the fact that they knew an agreement on the amount was impossible, is a logical leap. For these reasons, w00015 is considered to have a weak connection and is judged as the weakest component for not sufficiently supporting the claim.",
