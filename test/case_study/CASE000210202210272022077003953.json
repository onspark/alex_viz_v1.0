    "crime_fact": "Crime Details\n\nThe telephone financial fraud organization typically operates from abroad, such as China, and targets an unspecified number of victims in Korea. They deceive victims by randomly calling them and impersonating government or financial institutions, leading the deceived victims to transfer or deposit money into accounts managed by the fraudsters, or by directly receiving money from the victims, a method commonly known as 'voice phishing'. The organization is meticulously structured into cell units with specific roles: the 'mastermind' who oversees the entire operation and ensures organic communication between internal cell units, the 'manager' who follows the mastermind's orders to oversee and instruct internal members on deception techniques and cash collection methods, the 'call center' that deceives victims by making fraudulent calls impersonating government agencies, and the 'cash withdrawal agent/cash collector' who withdraws deposited victim funds or directly collects money from victims. The defendant, upon proposal from an unidentified member of the telephone financial fraud organization, conspired sequentially to commit telephone financial fraud by collecting cash from victims and delivering it, taking on the role of a cash collector.\n\nUnidentified members of the voice phishing organization, around December 27, 2021, in an unspecified location, called victim B, impersonating a representative of Bank C named D, and approached by offering a government-supported low-interest refinancing loan. They induced the victim to install a remote control malicious application, APPSUT (Bank C app), on their mobile phone and apply for a loan. Then, they called the victim again, impersonating Manager F of Bank E, where the victim had an existing loan, and lied that applying for a refinancing loan without repaying the existing loan would breach the contract, lead to legal action, result in a bad credit rating, and the loan applied for at Bank C would not be disbursed. They falsely claimed that repayment could be resolved through a 'loan play' method (direct repayment to a bank employee in cash), deceiving the victim into preparing cash under the pretext of repaying the existing loan.\n\nFollowing the instructions of an unidentified voice phishing organization member, the defendant met the victim near G in Heungdeok-gu, Cheongju, around 15:50 on December 29, 2021, and deceived the victim again by pretending to be a financial institution employee, receiving 20 million won in cash from the victim. The defendant then deposited this amount into account H (account number omitted) as directed by the voice phishing organization member.\n\nThus, the defendant, in conspiracy with unidentified members of the telephone financial fraud organization, deceived the victim and received property.",

Therefore, this guarantee fails to sufficiently prove a direct relevance or similarity between the cases, and the generalization based on such an assumption includes a logical leap, making it a weak guarantee.",
