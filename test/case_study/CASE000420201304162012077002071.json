    "crime_fact": "Criminal Facts\n1. Fraud Using Computers\na. The defendant, around 10:10 on November 12, 2011, in D located in Gangseo-gu, Busan, told the victim, a coworker named E, \"I urgently need 100,000 won,\" and the victim gave the defendant their Samsung card and HanaSK card, one of each, allowing them to withdraw about 100,000 won for use. The defendant, around the said time, inserted the cards into an ATM within the company and entered the PIN number provided by the victim, withdrawing 4 million won, which exceeded the consent given by the victim. Thus, the defendant acquired property benefits worth 3.9 million won by unauthorizedly entering information into a computer or other information processing device, causing it to process information.\nb. The defendant, around 10:10 on November 13, 2011, at the same location as above, told the victim, \"I urgently need 100,000 won,\" and the victim gave the defendant their HanaSK card, allowing them to withdraw about 100,000 won for use. The defendant, around the said time, inserted the card into an ATM within the company and entered the PIN number provided by the victim, withdrawing 900,000 won, which exceeded the consent given by the victim. Thus, the defendant acquired property benefits worth 800,000 won by unauthorizedly entering information into a computer or other information processing device, causing it to process information.\n2. Fraud\nThe defendant, around November 2011, had debts amounting to approximately 43 million won to financial institutions and had to pay about 2 million won in interest every month. The defendant used any money they acquired for internet gambling and had neither the intention nor the ability to repay money borrowed from others. Despite this, around November 16, 2011, within D mentioned above, the defendant lied to the victim E, saying, \"I will repay you within a week, including what I borrowed before, so please lend me 2 million won,\" and deceived the victim into handing over 2 million won on the same day. As such, until around January 10, 2012, the defendant received a total of 44.22 million won over 13 occasions, as listed in the attached crime summary table.",

    "target_reason": "The guarantee by w00014 argues that if the defendant planned to use the investment funds for personal purposes, it suggests that from the beginning, there was no intention or capability to return profits to the victim. However, this guarantee does not provide a sufficient logical link to directly prove the defendant's intent. The mere fact that the defendant used the funds for personal purposes does not directly lead to the conclusion that the defendant had no intention or capability to return the profits from the start. Since this is not direct evidence of the defendant's initial intent or plan, this guarantee is based on a speculative and weak logical connection, and therefore, is considered the weakest element.",
