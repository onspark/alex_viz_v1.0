    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\nCryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that is recorded in electronic form on computers and traded over the Internet without a physical counterpart, operating on a decentralized system utilizing blockchain technology, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being notable examples.\nCryptocurrencies that have built their own blockchain platform are referred to as 'coins', while those that have not and instead utilize the blockchain platforms of other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Qtum are called 'tokens', which can still be exchanged for coins despite being tokens.\nC Token is a token created using the Ethereum blockchain platform, initially issued by D Limited Liability Company (hereinafter referred to as 'D') around January 22, 2018, and listed on the Hong Kong F cryptocurrency exchange (hereinafter referred to as 'F Exchange') operated by the victim company E Limited Liability Company (E) around May 22, 2018, 16:00.\nBefore listing C Token on F Exchange, D conducted what is known as a 'private sale', selling C Tokens at a discount to those who contributed to or recognized the value of C Token's establishment, development, and listing, under the condition of a sales ban (Lock-up) for three months after listing. During the private sale period, investors who purchased C Tokens were provided with an electronic wallet, G, for managing and storing the purchased C Tokens, and technical measures were taken to enforce the sales ban on all C Tokens sold during the private sale period for three months after listing.\n1. Defendant A\nThe defendant, during the private sale period around January 2018, purchased 1,370,000 C Tokens and stored them in G.\nOn May 21, 2018, around 16:30, just before C Token was listed on F Exchange, the defendant, while sharing cryptocurrency-related information with other investors in a KakaoTalk group chat, heard from investor H that \"I tried transferring 676 of my locked-up C Tokens stored in G to my account on F Exchange as a test, and it appeared as if the transfer was successful with 676 C Tokens being created in the account, while the original number of C Tokens in G remained unchanged.\" This led the defendant to realize there was a system error in F Exchange and others.\nUtilizing this system error, the defendant attempted to continuously transfer C Tokens, which were under a sales ban for three months after listing, from G to the F Exchange account, creating C Tokens in the F Exchange account without actual transfer, and then decided to exchange these created C Tokens for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) through F Exchange.\nOn May 21, 2018, around 16:50, from the defendant's residence in Gangbuk-gu, Seoul, knowing that C Tokens were under a trading ban, the defendant accessed G, entered the defendant's F Exchange account address 'J' and the number of tokens '6' in the transfer field, and clicked the Generate Transaction button, thereby entering an unauthorized command into the computer or information processing device operated by the victim company running F Exchange, creating 6 C Tokens in the account without reducing the C Tokens stored in G.\nAs a result, the defendant entered unauthorized commands into the computer or information processing device of F Exchange, creating 6 C Tokens worth 81 KRW in the account, and from that time until May 21, 2018, 20:15, using the same method, created a total of 20,236,912 C Tokens worth 274,412,524 KRW in the defendant's F Exchange account as listed in Appendix Crime List 1, thereby acquiring property benefits of the same value and causing an obstruction in information processing, thereby disrupting the cryptocurrency trading brokerage business operated by the victim company running F Exchange.\n2. Defendant B\nThe defendant, during the private sale period around January 2018, purchased 115,000 C Tokens and stored them in G.\nOn May 21, 2018, around 16:30, just before C Token was listed on F Exchange, the defendant, while sharing cryptocurrency-related information with other investors in a KakaoTalk group chat, heard from investor H that \"I tried transferring 676 of my locked-up C Tokens stored in G to my account on F Exchange as a test, and it appeared as if the transfer was successful with 676 C Tokens being created in the account, while the original number of C Tokens in G remained unchanged.\" This led the defendant to realize there was a system error in F Exchange and others.\nUtilizing this system error, the defendant attempted to continuously transfer C Tokens, which were under a sales ban for three months after listing, from G to the F Exchange account, creating C Tokens in the F Exchange account without actual transfer, and then decided to exchange these created C Tokens for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) through F Exchange.\nOn May 21, 2018, around 20:21, from the defendant's residence in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, knowing that C Tokens were under a trading ban, the defendant accessed G, entered the defendant's F Exchange account address 'L' and the number of tokens '60,000' in the transfer field, and clicked the Generate Transaction button, thereby entering an unauthorized command into the computer or information processing device operated by the victim company running F Exchange, creating 60,000 C Tokens in the account without reducing the C Tokens stored in G.\nAs a result, the defendant entered unauthorized commands into the computer or information processing device of F Exchange, creating 60,000 C Tokens worth 813,600 KRW in the account, and from that time until May 22, 2018, 18:31, using the same method, created a total of 1,192,344 C Tokens worth 13,441,594 KRW in the defendant's F Exchange account as listed in Appendix Crime List 2, thereby acquiring property benefits of the same value and causing an obstruction in information processing, thereby disrupting the cryptocurrency trading brokerage business operated by the victim company running F Exchange.",
