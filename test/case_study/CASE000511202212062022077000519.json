    "crime_fact": "<translated text>\n\nCrime Details\n1. Installment Vehicle Fraud\nThe defendant, around October 2015, at an unspecified location, called the victim B and lied, saying, \"I need a vehicle to transport live eels, but I can't get a loan because I have bad credit. If you take out a capital loan and purchase a vehicle for me, I will pay back the principal and interest on your behalf.\"\nHowever, in reality, the defendant had no steady income or significant assets at the time and had no experience in the eel distribution business, making the success of the business unlikely. Therefore, the defendant had neither the intention nor the ability to pay the monthly loan principal and interest even if the vehicle was purchased under the victim's name.\nThe defendant deceived the victim in this manner and, having fooled the victim, received a Sorento vehicle worth 26,700,000 KRW purchased under the victim's name around October 29, 2015, thereby embezzling it.\n2. Loan Fraud\nThe defendant, around January 2016, at an unspecified location, called the victim B and lied, saying, \"Selling live eels can yield profits of tens of millions of won. If you lend me the money to buy the eels, I will share the profits with you and pay back the vehicle loan in full.\"\nHowever, in reality, the defendant had no steady income or significant assets at the time and had no experience in the eel distribution business, making the success of the business unlikely. Therefore, the defendant had neither the intention nor the ability to repay the borrowed money.\nThe defendant deceived the victim in this manner and, having fooled the victim, received a deposit of 2,000,000 KRW into the defendant's account around January 5, 2016, among other instances. Using the same method, from then until around September 14, 2016, the defendant received a total of 41,700,000 KRW deposited into the defendant's account from the victim on 6 occasions as listed in items 1 to 4, 9, and 10 of the attached crime list, thereby embezzling it. Additionally, as listed in items 5 to 8 of the same list, the defendant acquired property benefits equivalent to a total of 10,000,000 KRW by having it deposited 4 times under the guise of salary.",

However, this has a weak logical connection because there is no explicit evidence that the voice phishing organization could not use other methods or accounts. Voice phishing organizations can commit crimes using various means and methods, and they may not depend on a single account. Therefore, this guarantee is considered the weakest component because it has a weak direct relevance to the criminal facts and is based on broad assumptions about the working methods of the voice phishing organization.",
