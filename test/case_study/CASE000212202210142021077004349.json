Then, on May 13, 2015, he was sentenced by the Seoul Southern District Court to one year and six months in prison, and this judgment became final on August 19, 2015. Finally, on May 31, 2017, he was sentenced by the Seoul Southern District Court to four months in prison with a one-year suspended sentence, and this judgment became final on June 8, 2017.\n[Criminal Facts]\nDefendant A was the CEO of Company E, a business related to automatic excrement disposal devices located in Suite D of Building C in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, and Defendant B was the person who conducted sales activities with the title of 'Vice President' of the said company.\nThe defendants, in a situation where they had been paying principal and profits to senior creditors and investors with the investment funds received from junior creditors and investors (so-called 'Ponzi scheme'), conspired to embezzle money under the guise of borrowing from victim F due to the lack of profits and shortage of funds as the company's business performance was almost non-existent.\nAround March 25, 2009, at the office of Company E, the defendants lied to victim F, saying, \"We are running a business related to excrement disposal devices and need business funds. If you lend us money, we will definitely repay it with double the interest.\"\nHowever, the truth was that the defendants intended to use the money received from the victim for the aforementioned 'Ponzi scheme', and since the product sales were not going well and there were hardly any profits, they had neither the intention nor the ability to repay the victim.\nThus, by deceiving the victim in such a manner, the defendants received a transfer of 1,200,000 won to a bank account under the name of Defendant B at G Bank on the same day, and from around that time until around October 20, 2011, they received a total of 449,280,000 won over 88 occasions as listed in the attached crime list.\nConsequently, the defendants conspired to deceive the victim and received property.",

However, there is no mention of the drafting of the loan for consumption notarial deed in the specific facts of this case. Therefore, since the facts (datum) that would serve as the basis for this claim have not been presented, the claim lacks direct relevance to the factual circumstances of the case, and consequently, there is a shortage of evidence to support the validity of the claim. For these reasons, there is a lack of logical connection between the warrant and datum of claim c00014, which can be seen as a primary factor weakening the claim.",
