'D', an unidentified mastermind, directed the execution of the fraud, withdrawal of money, and methods of transferring money to China. F was responsible for recruiting mule accounts and managing cash withdrawals, the defendant and G were in charge of recruiting mule accounts and managing cash withdrawal agents, H, I, and J were tasked with withdrawing cash, and other unidentified members were responsible for contacting numerous unspecified individuals via phone or messenger in a sequentially conspired manner.\nFollowing such conspiracy, the unidentified members of the voice phishing fraud group acquired the victim K's agricultural cooperative account number, password, telebanking registration phone number, telebanking password, and security card serial number through unknown means, and then, around 02:15 on June 28, 2014, from an unspecified location in China, they used the victim's financial information to transfer 2,252,000 won from the victim's agricultural cooperative account (account number L) to the defendant's Hyundai Securities account, among other transactions, transferring a total of 123,792,000 won to 15 mule accounts including the defendant's Hyundai Securities account from June 26, 2014, 22:51 to June 28, 2014, 02:18, as listed in the attached crime summary table 1. Following the instructions of 'D' and F, the defendant, G, H, I, and J immediately withdrew the 2,252,000 won, while other unidentified members of the fraud group withdrew the remaining money.\nThus, the defendant, in conspiracy with 'D' and other members of the voice phishing fraud group, acquired property benefits totaling 123,792,000 won by unauthorizedly entering information into a computer or other information processing device to process information.\n「2015고단6208」\nThe defendant, along with unidentified individuals known as 'D' (operating in China), P, 'E' (domestic mastermind), F, G, H, I, J, and other members of a so-called voice phishing fraud group, deceived numerous unspecified individuals in Korea through phone calls or internet messengers, pretending to arrange compensated dating to receive money under the guise of introduction fees, lying about providing loans to receive money as commission fees, and using illegally obtained personal information to transfer money through telebanking methods, among various fraud acts to embezzle money. 'D', an unidentified mastermind, directed the execution of the fraud, withdrawal of money, and methods of transferring money to China. F was responsible for recruiting mule accounts and managing cash withdrawals, the defendant and G were in charge of recruiting mule accounts and managing cash withdrawal agents, H, I, and J were tasked with withdrawing cash, and other unidentified members were responsible for contacting numerous unspecified individuals via phone or messenger in a sequentially conspired manner.\nFollowing such conspiracy, from around 19:45 on June 17, 2014, through KakaoTalk, the unidentified members of the voice phishing fraud group lied to the victim M under the name N about arranging a compensated date, deceiving the victim into transferring a total of 400,000 won in two transactions to the defendant's agricultural cooperative account (O) as the cost of the compensated date, and from that time until June 30 of the same year, they received a total of 10,435,000 won in 9 transactions as listed in the attached crime summary table 2, serial numbers 1 to 9.\nThus, the defendant, in conspiracy with 'D' and other members of the voice phishing fraud group, deceived the victims and acquired property benefits totaling 10,435,000 won in 9 transactions.",
