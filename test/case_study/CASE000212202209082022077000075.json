For the association project to proceed smoothly, my brother needs to be released soon. To release him, we need a settlement with you. If you lend us 150 million won as a settlement, we will change your business agent share in the association project from 44% to 53% and pay you 60 million won as interest.\"\nHowever, in reality, it was impossible to settle with the victim of D's criminal case with the 150 million won, and the defendant had no intention of using the money received from the victim for the settlement with the victim of the criminal case. Instead, the defendant planned to use it for personal living expenses, debt repayment, and abnormal lobbying funds for D's release.\nBy deceiving the victim in such a manner, the defendant fraudulently received 150 million won from the victim, who was deceived, on August 9, 2019, into the bank account of H, the defendant's mother-in-law, at I Bank, and embezzled it.",

However, this argument focuses only on the specific situation of verifying the amount of cryptocurrency held and lacks direct relevance to the given criminal facts. The criminal facts are related to fraud using gift cards, not to the verification of the amount of cryptocurrency held. Therefore, since w00012's logical connection is not directly related to the criminal facts, it is considered a weak argument.",
