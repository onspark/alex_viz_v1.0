The defendant A was sentenced to 3 years in prison for fraud and other charges by the Busan District Court on February 23, 2018, and the judgment became final on January 17, 2019.\n\nThe defendants, in conspiracy with an unidentified person, decided to gain financial benefits equivalent to the amount loaded on the gift cards by selling gift cards to a gift card business that specializes in trading gift cards, and then using the card information, which they had previously written down on paper and knew at the time of purchase, to buy other products.",

    "target_reason": "Explanation: w00014 argues that the size and abnormality of the compensation received by the defendant can infer the intentionality of the criminal act, but this is based on excessive assumptions. Excessive compensation does not necessarily indicate an awareness of the illegal nature and risks involved. The mere fact that the defendant received a high amount of compensation does not directly prove that the defendant was aware of participating in a criminal act. Therefore, this argument is merely hypothetical and only indirectly suggests the intentionality of the criminal act. For these reasons, w00014 can be seen as a weak argument with a weak logical connection and lacking direct relevance to the criminal facts.",
