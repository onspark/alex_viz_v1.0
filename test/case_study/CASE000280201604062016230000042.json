    "crime_fact": "<Crime Details>\nThe defendant conspired with an unidentified person who called people, impersonating prosecutors and others, and deceived them by claiming that their personal information had been leaked and that they would provide a personal financial protection device. The scheme involved having the victims access an internet site created by the unidentified person and enter their personal information, which was then used to transfer deposit amounts to the defendant's account. The defendant would then withdraw the money and deliver it to the unidentified person.\nOn July 29, 2015, around 10:55, from an unknown location, the unidentified person called victim C, impersonating an official from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, and lied, saying, \"Your personal information has been exposed, and under the cooperation of the Financial Supervisory Service, we will provide a personal financial protection device. Log into the internet site (D) and enter your account number and password among other information.\" The deceived victim accessed the said site and entered the relevant information. Using this information, the unidentified person entered false information or unauthorized commands into a computer or other information processing device, or unauthorizedly altered information, thereby transferring 30 million won from the victim's Shinhan Bank account (E) to the defendant's post office account (F).",

However, this argument is logically weak considering the fact that the defendant obtained the money from the victim through lies. Since the defendant's claim of making money through investment was false and the intention was actually for personal use, it is difficult to see the victim's consent as genuine. Therefore, assuming the victim's consent in this situation is not logically valid, and this warrant is based on assumptions that are not directly related to the essence of the case.",
