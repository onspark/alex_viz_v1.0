Subsequently, around May 28, 2020, at an undisclosed location, using a mobile phone (phone number omitted), they posted an advertisement on E Cafe, falsely claiming to sell a coffee machine, ice maker, etc., and deceived the victim F, who contacted them after seeing the post, into transferring 2.2 million KRW as payment for the goods into the above-mentioned D bank account under B's name on the same day.\nThus, the defendants conspired to deceive the victim and received property from the victim who was deceived.\n\"2021고단1039\" - Defendant B\nAround 16:00 on July 13, 2021, Defendant B entered room H of building G in Geoje City as a guest and threw a coffee pot owned by the victim I against a vanity mirror, breaking it and causing damage worth approximately 50,000 KRW to the coffee pot and approximately 500,000 KRW to the vanity mirror.",

    "target_reason": "Explanation: The guarantor w00012 argues that the act of the defendant creating a fair document for a monetary loan agreement as a joint and several debtor to the victim shows a clear intent to deceive the victim in order to borrow money. However, this guarantee does not provide specific evidence or a logical connection necessary to directly prove the defendant's intent. The claim that the creation of the fair document for a monetary loan agreement itself indicates a clear intent to deceive is too broad and abstract, and it does not present a universal recognition or legal basis that such an act necessarily leads to deceptive behavior. Therefore, this guarantee is based on assumptions and has a weak logical connection in clearly proving the defendant's intent to deceive.",
