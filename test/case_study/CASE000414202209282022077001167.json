    "crime_fact": "Criminal Facts\n1. Conspiracy Relationship\nThe voice phishing organization, operating from areas in China or other regions difficult for domestic investigative agencies to track, deceives numerous victims in Korea through impersonation of financial institutions, loan fraud, etc., using internet calls. They trick victims into transferring money to accounts they manage or directly receiving money from them, a method commonly known as 'voice phishing'. The organization is structured into point organizations with divided roles: the 'mastermind' who oversees the entire operation and manages internal communication between each point organization, the 'manager' who follows the mastermind's orders to supervise internal members and instructs them on deception techniques and cash collection methods, the 'lure/call center' that calls numerous victims pretending to be government agencies to deceive them, and the 'cash withdrawal/collection agent' who withdraws deposited victim funds or directly collects money from victims. They also operate relay offices to change internet phone numbers to domestic phone numbers using VoIP gateways, exploiting the fact that victims are more likely to answer calls from domestic numbers. Recently, to avoid crackdowns on domestic relay offices and for convenience of movement, they have started using mobile relay devices by inserting SIM cards purchased from specific carriers into mobile phones, notably using Samsung Galaxy phones' CMC method and iPhones' 'Izzbie' app for coordination.\nThe defendant, a Thai national, accepted an offer in early April 2022 from unidentified members of a voice phishing organization (referred to as 'D, etc.') to install and manage relay devices for a monthly payment of 3 million won. Following 'D, etc.'s' instructions, the defendant rented room G in building F, Buk-gu, Busan, in mid-April 2022, met with an unidentified man to receive mobile phones with SIM cards, chargers, and other equipment, and from then until around June 9, 2022, linked mobile phones with the voice phishing organization members' iPads and other devices using the 'Izzbie' app on iPhones, managed the power of the mobile phones according to the call center's operating hours, and replaced any suspended SIM cards with new ones as per the instructions of 'D, etc.' and other unidentified members of the voice phishing organization.\n\n2. Criminal Facts\na. Violation of the Telecommunications Business Act\n(1) Alteration of Caller ID Display\nIt is prohibited for anyone to deceive others for financial gain or to inflict harm such as verbal abuse, threats, or harassment by making calls and falsely displaying the caller's phone number through alteration.\nDespite this, the defendant, using a mobile relay device (iPhone) managed by them in room G, building F, Buk-gu, Busan, around May 19, 2022, altered the caller ID as described in section (1) so that the phone number sent by unidentified members of the voice phishing organization to person H appeared as '(phone number 1 omitted)', among other instances from May 9, 2022, to June 9, 2022, totaling 1,170 times as listed in the crime summary table, displaying the caller ID as phone numbers '(phone number 1 omitted)' to '(phone number 6 omitted)', registered under other people's names.\nThus, the defendant conspired with unidentified members of the voice phishing organization to deceive others for financial gain by altering the caller's phone number.\n(2) Mediation of Communication for Others\nNo one is allowed to mediate or provide others' communications using the telecommunications services provided by telecommunications business operators.\nNevertheless, the defendant, while managing a mobile relay device (iPhone) in room G, building F, Buk-gu, Busan, around May 19, 2022, enabled unidentified members of the voice phishing organization in China and other places to make calls using the SIM connected to the domestic phone number '(phone number 1 omitted)' through the defendant's relay device, among other instances from May 4, 2022, to June 9, 2022, totaling 2,309 times as listed in the crime summary table, allowing communication with numerous people through domestically converted mobile phone numbers.\nThus, the defendant conspired with unidentified members of the voice phishing organization to mediate or provide others' communications using the telecommunications services provided by telecommunications business operators.\n(3) Operation of an Unregistered Telecommunications Business\nAnyone wishing to operate a telecommunications business must register with the Minister of Science and ICT according to the Presidential Decree, including financial and technical capabilities, user protection plans, and other business plans.\nThe defendant operated a telecommunications business without registering with the Minister of Science and ICT from around May 4, 2022, to June 9, 2022, in room G, building F, Buk-gu, Busan, managing mobile relay devices such as iPhones, enabling unidentified members of the voice phishing organization to call numerous people in Korea, converting the calls to domestic mobile phone numbers as listed in the crime summary table, totaling 2,309 times.\nThus, the defendant conspired with unidentified members of the voice phishing organization to operate a telecommunications business without registering with the Minister of Science and ICT.\nb.

Once your innocence is proven, your accounts will be restored, and the cash will be handed over by our sent employee.\"\nIn reality, the unidentified members of the voice phishing organization were neither investigators nor prosecutors, and they had no intention or ability to return the money received from the victim.\nThe unidentified members of the voice phishing organization deceived the victim and received 28 million won in cash from the victim between 11:32 and 12:00 on May 26, 2022, in front of U in Mapo-gu, Seoul, among other instances, receiving a total of 96,700,000 won from the victim through the same method until around May 27, 2022, as listed in the crime summary table, totaling 5 times.\nThus, the defendant conspired with unidentified members of the voice phishing organization to deceive the victim and receive property from the victim.\n(4) Fraud against Victim B\nFollowing the conspiracy, the defendant, from mid-April 2022 in room G, building F, Buk-gu, Busan, managed a mobile relay device (iPhone) into which a SIM card purchased from a specific carrier was inserted, converting the caller ID used by unidentified members of the voice phishing organization to '(phone number 3 omitted)' (subscriber name V).\nAn unidentified member of the voice phishing organization contacted victim B around May 26, 2022, from an unknown location, pretending to be an investigator from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, saying, \"You are involved in an identity theft case, and an investigation is needed.\" Then, another unidentified member of the voice phishing organization, using the defendant's relay device to convert the caller ID, contacted the victim pretending to be a prosecutor, saying, \"It needs to be checked if your account is normal, so try taking out a loan.
