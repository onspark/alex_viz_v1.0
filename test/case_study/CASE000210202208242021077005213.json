    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\n\nThe defendant, since the beginning of November 2017, started visiting the 'D Restaurant' operated by the victim C in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, B, and became acquainted with the victim.\n1. Fraud\nAround the beginning of November 2017, at the aforementioned restaurant, the defendant lied to the victim, saying, \"Isn't the restaurant work too hard? Don't work so hard; I have a place where I'm investing, so if you lend me money, I will make you money. If you lend me 10,000,000 won, I will generate a profit of 500,000 won for you.\" However, in reality, the defendant intended to use the money received from the victim for his own debt repayment, living expenses, stock investments, etc., and thus had neither the intention nor the ability to invest the money properly to repay the promised interest and the principal amount borrowed to the victim.\nThe defendant deceived the victim in this manner and received a transfer of 3,000,000 won to the defendant's postal account (account number omitted) under the guise of a loan on November 24, 2017, and from then until November 7, 2018, received a total of 293,850,000 won in 32 separate transactions as listed in Crime Details Table 1.\n2. Fraud Using Computer, etc.\nWhile borrowing and using the victim C's credit card for living expenses and other payments, promising to pay the card bills, the defendant decided to use the money through loan services and cash withdrawals from ATMs, taking advantage of having possession of the said credit card.\na. Crime using ARS loan service\nOn June 26, 2018, at an unknown location, the defendant used the ARS loan service of victim's company E Card, pretending to be C himself by unauthorizedly entering known personal information such as C's social security number, E Card number, and PIN, to apply for a credit loan, and received a transfer of 6,000,000 won to C's F Bank account under the guise of a loan on the same day. From then until January 7, 2019, using the same method, the defendant received a total of 59,300,000 won in 17 separate transactions as listed in Crime Details Table 2, thereby acquiring the same amount of financial benefit.\nb. Crime using a cash dispenser\nOn June 29, 2018, at an unknown location, the defendant inserted the G Card, which had been given by C and was in C's name, into a cash dispenser managed by victim's company F Bank, pressed the cash service application button, and unauthorizedly entered the known G Card PIN and other information to process the information, thereby withdrawing 1,000,000 won in cash under the guise of a cash service. From then until November 26, 2018, using the same method, the defendant withdrew a total of 8,000,000 won in 12 separate transactions as listed in Crime Details Table 3, thereby acquiring the same amount of financial benefit.",

The mere fact that the defendant used the money for personal purposes does not clearly prove that the promise to facilitate a loan was false from the beginning. Therefore, this logical connection is based on assumption and has weak direct relevance to the criminal facts.",
