    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\nThe voice phishing (hereinafter referred to as 'voice phishing') organization operates call centers overseas and commits crimes by impersonating financial institutions or investigative agencies to embezzle money from an unspecified number of people. This organization divides roles strictly among 'call center consultants' who make fraudulent calls to embezzle victim's money, 'money transfer agents' who send the embezzled money overseas, and 'masterminds' who oversee them, and operates in a cell organization form to avoid tracking by investigative agencies by using so-called 'burner phones' or communicating with each other through mobile chatting applications such as 'Telegram' and 'KakaoTalk'.\nMeanwhile, the voice phishing organization, knowing that people do not answer international calls or internet calls (numbers starting with D) but do answer calls or text messages sent from landlines or mobile phones, has installed relay stations in Korea and is using VoIP GateWay (a telecommunications device that relays calls between multiple mobile phones, hereinafter referred to as 'relay device') at these relay stations. These relay stations rent studios or goshiwons in Korea, install relay devices, and connect Korean mobile carrier's USIM to the relay device or insert it into Samsung smartphones and then connect it to Samsung tablets and other devices at overseas call centers using the Call & Message Continuity (hereinafter 'CMC') feature, or insert the USIM of a Korean mobile carrier into an Apple smartphone and then connect it to iPads and other devices at overseas call centers using the Calls on Other Devices (hereinafter 'COD') feature, thereby using the devices as relay devices (hereinafter referred to as 'methods using CMC feature, etc.') to commit crimes.\nThe defendant, around February 18, 2022, received a proposal from an unknown person (alias 'F', 'G') whom he met through a job advertisement on website 'E', and from another unknown person (alias 'H') whom he met through a job advertisement on 'E' around March 16, 2022, to the effect that 'if you install USIM chips opened in other people's names into Samsung, Apple smartphone devices and use methods such as the CMC feature to make it appear as if calls from overseas call centers are coming from domestic mobile phone numbers, and manage the devices, a certain amount of money will be paid into your account as a reward.' Following the instructions of the unknown persons, the defendant agreed to take on the role of changing the caller ID to a domestic mobile phone number using the CMC feature, etc., and another unknown member of the voice phishing organization agreed in sequence to take on roles such as impersonating financial institutions to embezzle money from victims.\n1. Violation of the Telecommunications Business Act\nNo one shall mediate another person's communication using the telecommunication service provided by a telecommunications business operator or provide it for another person's communication.\nNevertheless, following the instructions of an unknown voice phishing organization member (alias 'G'), around April 7, 2022, in front of J building of I apartment in Gangseo-gu, Seoul, parked in a Sonata sedan (car number omitted), the defendant inserted a USIM (phone number omitted) opened in a third party's name into a mobile phone and activated the CMC feature, etc., to enable calls from the tablet and iPad of overseas call center members to be made with the above domestic mobile phone number, among others, provided a total of 44 lines opened in a third party's name for communication purposes to unknown persons from around February 18, 2022, to April 7, 2022, as listed in the attached crime list (1).\nAs a result, the defendant conspired with unknown members of the voice phishing organization to mediate another person's communication using the telecommunication service provided by a telecommunications business operator or provide it for another person's communication.\n2. Fraud\nIn accordance with such conspiracy, the defendant managed mobile phones used for voice phishing crimes, and an unknown telephone financial fraud organization member, around March 18, 2022, at an unknown location, using a mobile phone (phone number omitted) managed by the defendant, called victim K pretending to be an agent of company L M and lied, saying 'You must repay the existing loan in N to receive a low-interest loan, and if you do not repay it today, a penalty of 16 million won will be incurred, so repay at least 5 million won,' thereby deceiving the victim into handing over 5 million won in front of P kindergarten in Seongnam-si, Bundang-gu, on the same day, through an unknown telephone financial fraud organization member, among others, receiving a total of 185.5 million won from a total of 7 victims from around that time to April 4, 2022, as listed in the attached crime list (2).\nAs a result, the defendant conspired with unknown members of the voice phishing organization to deceive victims and embezzled a total of 185.5 million won from them.",

    "target_reason": "Explanation: c00012's claim argues that the use of the defendant's IP address and related information is clear evidence of conspiracy, but this has a somewhat weak link. It is difficult to clearly prove intentional criminal activity solely based on the use of an IP address. An IP address can be shared by multiple people, and especially in homes or public places, multiple users can use the same IP. Therefore, the warrant (w00012) that the use of an IP address can be considered clear evidence of conspiracy does not provide a sufficiently strong logical connection. For this reason, c00012's claim can be seen as having relatively weak grounds compared to other claims.",
