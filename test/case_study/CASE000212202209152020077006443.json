    "crime_fact": "Crime Details\nThe defendant, around January 17, 2019, at an unknown location, lied to the victim B by stating, \"From October to December 2018, I made over 1.5 billion won in sales and tens of millions of won in profit through the C rice business. In 2019, I plan to actively pursue the C rice sales business. If you pay 50 million won, I will open a C rice direct sales store in Busan for you. The 50 million won will be used as a deposit for the C direct sales store, and the rice will be supplied by C; you only need to handle the distribution. I will introduce you to the clients. A monthly profit of ten million won is guaranteed.\"\n\nHowever, in reality, the defendant intended to use the deposit received from the victim for operating funds and repayment of existing debts of D Corporation, a bearing export company he previously operated, and had neither the intention nor the ability to allow the victim to operate a C rice direct sales store or to supply C rice.\n\nBy deceiving the victim in this manner, the defendant fraudulently received a total of 50 million won in the name of a deposit for the C rice direct sales store: 20 million won on January 18, 2019, 27 million won on January 25, 2019, and 3 million won on January 30, 2019, transferred to the C Bank account under the name of D Corporation.",

However, this argument is not directly related to the facts of the crime and does not provide specific evidence or logical basis regarding the defendant's financial status or intention to repay.
