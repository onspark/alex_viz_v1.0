    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\nThe defendants called a large number of unspecified individuals, pretending to be employees of a liquor company, and deceived them into leasing their bank accounts and other access media by promising to pay rent for them. After obtaining their bank accounts, cash cards, and other access media, they provided these to an unidentified financial fraud organization involved in voice phishing and other financial frauds, receiving compensation from the criminal organization. If the provided bank account was blocked or transactions were not possible, they contacted the account holder to unblock it, and if the account holder withdrew the deposited money arbitrarily, they conspired with the criminal organization to recover a certain amount.\n\nAccordingly, Defendant A rented an office to obtain access media, installed telephones, computers, etc., and instructed Defendants B, C, D, etc., to recruit access media, promising to pay them based on the number of access media they collected. They conspired to play roles in which Defendant A would oversee the recruitment of \"mule\" bank accounts by providing the collected access media to the criminal organization and receiving compensation, while Defendants B, C, D followed Defendant A's instructions to recruit access media from a large number of unspecified individuals.\n1. Access Media Acquisition Crime\nFollowing the conspiracy, around late August 2014, in office 903 of Building I in Ilsan-dong, Goyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, which served as the mule bank account recruitment office, they called Victim J, falsely claiming to be employee K of an imported liquor company, and lied that they would pay 6 million won per month if J leased them bank accounts and other access media.\n\nIn reality, the defendants were neither employees of a liquor company nor had the intention or ability to pay the rent even if they received the bank accounts and other access media.\nThe defendants thus deceived Victim J and, around 13:00 on August 29, 2014, at J's office in Masanhoewon-gu, Changwon-si, received a cash card connected to J's Saemaul Geumgo account (M) and a note with the password through a courier service, thereby acquiring them.\n\nFollowing this method, in collaboration with members of the unidentified criminal organization, Defendants A, B, and C acquired a total of 121 bank accounts connected to cash cards and passwords from around July 16, 2014, to November 6, 2014, as listed in Crime List 1, and Defendant D acquired 67 bank accounts connected to cash cards and passwords from November 3, 2014, to November 6, 2014, as listed from item 55 to 121 in Crime List 1.\n2. Money Acquisition Crime\nThe defendants delivered the collected bank accounts, cash cards, and passwords to unidentified individuals (nicknamed 'N', 'O', 'P'), and members of the unidentified financial fraud criminal organization called Victim Q around 12:30 on September 1, 2014, from an unknown location, claiming to be an employee of Kookmin Bank and stating that due to a policy change related to resident registration numbers starting from September 1, due to voice phishing, etc., the victim should enter their account number, password, and OTP (One-Time Password) generator password.\n\nUsing the financial information obtained in this manner, the criminal organization members accessed Kookmin Bank's internet banking between 12:47 and 12:50 on the same day and transferred a total of 84,740,000 won in four transactions from Victim Q's Kookmin Bank account R to Saemaul Geumgo account M under J's name, to post office account T under S's name, to post office account V under U's name, and to Industrial Bank of Korea account X under W's name, thereby acquiring the money.\n\nIn the same manner, Defendants A, B, and C acquired a total of 2,453,427,559 won from 56 victims from around July 16, 2014, to November 6, 2014, as listed in Crime List 2, and Defendant D acquired a total of 13,186,000 won from 3 victims from November 3, 2014, to November 6, 2014, as listed in Crime List 3.",

However, this seems to be an application of legal principles in a generalized manner. Yet, this warranty does not provide specific cases or legal grounds to support that defendant A's absence from the site does not exempt them from responsibility for the fraudulent act. Therefore, this warranty can be seen as an overly broad interpretation of legal principles, especially without specific circumstances or legal precedents related to defendant A's absence at the time of borrowing. For these reasons, w00013's warranty is considered the weakest component.",
