    "crime_fact": "Crime Details\nThe defendant, in early June 2012, lied to the victim B, saying, \"If you buy G stocks, you will make several times the profit. My friend 'H' is a director at G company, and if you purchase G stocks through this friend, you will make several times the profit, so if you lend me 100 million won, I will give you back the principal and the profit.\"\nHowever, in reality, the defendant had already borrowed 500,000,000 won from the victim around February 2008 under the pretext of purchasing stocks of company I but had failed to repay it and had no other source of income, thus lacking the intention or ability to repay the victim even if they received the money, nor did they have the intention or ability to use it for the purchase of G stocks or to pay the profits.\nThe defendant, deceiving the victim, received a check worth 100,000,000 won (K) from the victim at a cafe of unknown name located near J in Songpa-gu, Seoul, in the same month.\nThus, the defendant defrauded the victim and received property.",

    "target_reason": "Explanation: c00014 argues that the defendant's past criminal record and the similarity of the current case can prove that the defendant acted with the intent to commit fraud. However, the weakness of this argument lies in the fact that while d00014's data mentions the defendant's past criminal record, it lacks a detailed explanation of how exactly this record is specifically similar to the current case. Inferring the defendant's intent in the current case merely based on the fact that they committed a crime in the past, without clearly explaining the direct relevance or similarity between the past criminal record and the current case, is a logical leap. Therefore, this argument fails to provide sufficient evidence and has a weakness in that it does not directly connect to the specific facts of the current case.",
