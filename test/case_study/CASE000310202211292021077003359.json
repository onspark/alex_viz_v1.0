    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\n\nThe defendant A, after developing a type of 'ERC-20' token, D, which had no significant property value due to the inability to establish an independent blockchain network, deceived unspecified investors by claiming that D would be listed on exchanges and could be used as a valid payment method in convenience stores in China, etc., thereby suggesting that holding D given as a return on investment would generate future investment profits, and conspired with defendant B to embezzle the investment funds received in this manner. In return for attracting investors, defendant B agreed to share the embezzled funds.\n\nAccordingly, around July 23, 2018, at a coffee shop in Yeoksam-dong, Seoul, of unknown name, defendant B lied to the victims E and C, who are a married couple, stating, \"D will be listed on a cryptocurrency exchange within about 3 months, and it is expected to be actually used as a payment method like H in convenience stores nationwide operated by 'G', an organization equivalent to F in China. Invest in the business and keep D for future profits.\"\n\nHowever, in reality, the defendants lacked the professional knowledge and funds to list D on an exchange, and had no concrete plan to secure the approximately 10 billion won needed to establish the system required for D to be used as a payment method. Therefore, even if they received investment funds for the D project from the victims, they had neither the intention nor the ability to generate investment returns for them.\n\nConspiring together, the defendants deceived the victims in the aforementioned manner and, as a result, received 40 million won into the bank account of defendant A at I Bank (account number omitted) around 19:05 on July 23, 2018.",
