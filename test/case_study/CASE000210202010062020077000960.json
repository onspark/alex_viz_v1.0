    "crime_fact": "1. Summary of the Indictment\nThe defendant, around April 15, 2019, in Seoul or an unknown location, impersonated 'C' during a phone call and via KakaoTalk, and lied to the victim B, saying, \"If you transfer your EOS coins to a Meet.One app account, you will receive airdropped cryptocurrencies in the amount you transferred. If you move your 18,000 EOS coins, you can make about 20 million won through the airdrop.\" The defendant instructed the victim on how to create a Meet.One app account, leading the victim to create account D. However, the victim, distrusting the account, did not transfer any EOS coins to it.\nOn May 2, 2019, at approximately 20:34, at the victim's residence located in E building, F apartment, Gwonseon-gu, Suwon city, the defendant wrote and provided a written promise to the victim, stating, \"The defendant will take responsibility if the EOS coins stored in the Meet.One app account (D) disappear following the defendant's advice.\" Trusting this, the victim transferred 18,000 EOS coins, owned by the victim and stored in exchange G, to account D at around 21:14 the same day. The next day, at approximately 03:07, in Seoul or an unknown location, the defendant accessed the Meet.One app account D using an unknown computer and, by entering the discovered private key of the account, moved 17,988 EOS coins (valued at 5,540 won each) to an unknown account H, thereby acquiring property benefits worth approximately 99.65 million won.",

However, this guarantee has a weak link in indirectly proving the intentionality of the crime. The assumption that excessive compensation indicates the intentionality of the crime is too broad and not a universal standard that can be applied in all cases. Moreover, since no specific evidence or amount of excessive compensation has been presented, this guarantee does not provide sufficient grounds. Therefore, this guarantee has a weak logical connection in proving the intentionality of the crime, and it can be seen as having low relevance to the criminal facts.",
