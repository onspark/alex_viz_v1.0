    "crime_fact": "Crime Facts\nThe organization committing telecommunications financial fraud (commonly known as 'voice phishing') operates call centers overseas, including in China, and randomly calls a large number of people residing in Korea. By impersonating financial institutions or investigative agencies, they fraudulently obtain money. The organization is divided into roles such as the mastermind who manages the organic communication between members, the call center that calls domestic victims to request money transfers, the relay manager who installs and manages relays to change the caller ID to a domestic mobile phone number '010-****-****' when the call center makes a call, the recruiter who recruits targets for relay installation, the account and cash card recruiter, and the cash collector.\nRecently, as crackdowns on relays have increased, the relay managers have evolved their methods to avoid detection. They insert SIM cards registered under someone else's name into smartphones manufactured in country B and activate the 'Call/Text on Other Devices' feature (hereinafter referred to as 'CMC function'), allowing them to use domestic mobile phone numbers from tablets and other devices linked to the smartphone to make calls from abroad.\nIn August 2021, the defendant decided to participate in the crime as a 'relay manager' after receiving a proposal through the part-time job recruitment website 'C' from unidentified recruiters. The proposal was to purchase a used smartphone, activate it with the SIM card and personal information they provided, and then enable the CMC function as instructed in exchange for a certain amount of money as a fee.\n1. Violation of the Telecommunications Business Act\nNo one shall mediate or provide others' communications using the telecommunications service provided by a telecommunications business operator.\nNevertheless, from around August 4, 2021, to September 27, 2021, the defendant, following the instructions of the unidentified voice phishing recruiters, installed a smartphone with a SIM chip connected to a line opened under the name 'F' in his residence in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, D, E, and activated the CMC function, among others, for a total of 14 lines as listed in the crime summary table, enabling unidentified voice phishing organization members abroad to make calls using those phone numbers.\nThus, the defendant conspired with the unidentified voice phishing organization members to provide telecommunications services for others' communications.\n2. Fraud\na. Fraud against victim G\nAn unidentified voice phishing inducer (posing as an employee of H Bank) called victim G from an unknown location around August 13, 2021, recommending a debt consolidation loan application and inducing the installation of an application containing malware. Another unidentified inducer (posing as an employee of I Bank) called the victim using the method that displays the caller ID as '(phone number 2 omitted)' through the smartphone with the CMC function activated by the defendant, and said, \"Attempting a debt consolidation loan while having an existing loan is a violation of the Financial Transactions Act. You must repay the existing loan of 14 million won.\" The defendant enabled the inducer to communicate with the victim by activating the CMC function as described.\nHowever, in reality, the defendant and the unidentified voice phishing inducers, including the voice phishing organization members, were not bank employees and had neither the intention nor the ability to execute the loan for the victim.\nThe inducers deceived the victim with lies, leading the victim to hand over 14 million won in cash to an unidentified voice phishing organization member acting as a cash collector in front of J apartment in Gangseo-gu, Seoul, around 11:00 on the same month's 18th.\nThus, the defendant conspired with the unidentified voice phishing organization members to defraud the victim and obtained 14 million won in cash.\nb. Fraud against victim K\nAn unidentified voice phishing inducer (posing as an employee of L Bank) called victim K from an unknown location around August 17, 2021, recommending a debt consolidation loan application and inducing the installation of an application containing malware. Shortly after, another unidentified inducer (posing as an M employee) called the victim using the method that displays the caller ID as '(phone number 3 omitted)' through the smartphone with the CMC function activated by the defendant, and said, \"Attempting a debt consolidation loan while having an existing loan is a violation of the Financial Transactions Act. You must repay the existing loan of 18.96 million won.\" The defendant enabled the inducer to communicate with the victim by activating the CMC function as described.\nHowever, in reality, the defendant and the unidentified voice phishing inducers, including the voice phishing organization members, were not bank employees and had neither the intention nor the ability to execute the loan for the victim.\nThe inducers deceived the victim with lies, leading the victim to hand over 18.96 million won in cash to an unidentified voice phishing organization member acting as a cash collector in front of '0 Miryong branch' in Gunsan City, Jeonbuk, around 12:58 on the same month's 19th.\nThus, the defendant conspired with the unidentified voice phishing organization members to defraud the victim and obtained 18.96 million won in cash.\nc. Fraud against victim P\nAn unidentified voice phishing inducer (posing as an employee of L Bank) called victim P from an unknown location around August 19, 2021, recommending a debt consolidation loan application and inducing the installation of an application containing malware. Shortly after, another unidentified inducer (posing as an I Bank employee) called the victim using the method that displays the caller ID as '(phone number 4 omitted)' through the smartphone with the CMC function activated by the defendant, and said, \"You must repay the existing loan to be eligible for a new loan. Repay the loan in cash directly to the employee.\" The defendant enabled the inducer to communicate with the victim by activating the CMC function as described.\nHowever, in reality, the defendant and the unidentified voice phishing inducers, including the voice phishing organization members, were not bank employees and had neither the intention nor the ability to execute the loan for the victim.\nThe inducers deceived the victim with lies, leading the victim to hand over 5 million won in cash to an unidentified voice phishing organization member acting as a cash collector in front of Q, R in Jinju City, Gyeongnam, around 17:15 on the same month's 20th.\nThus, the defendant conspired with the unidentified voice phishing organization members to defraud the victim and obtained 5 million won in cash.",
