Around October 16, 2019, at a restaurant named 'F' located in Seo-gu, Gwangju, which the defendant operated under the name D, the defendant lied to the employee, the victim, stating, \"If you, as the business owner of the above-mentioned 'C' bar, apply for and receive a liquor loan of 30 million won from (Limited) G and 5 million won from H and then give that loan money to me, I will definitely repay that debt.\" Believing this lie, the victim transferred 29.8 million won out of the 30 million won received from the so-called liquor loan from (Limited) G and the 5 million won loaned from H to an unknown account on October 17, 2019, at the same location, and on October 18, 2019, respectively. Continuing, around November 4, 2019, in Gwangju or an unknown location, the defendant called the victim and lied again, saying, \"If you apply for a youth startup loan of 5 million won from the Credit Guarantee Foundation, receive a guarantee certificate, and then apply for and receive a loan from J Bank and give that loan money to me, I will definitely repay that debt.\" Believing this, the victim, around the same time and place, used the 5 million won loaned from J Bank to offset the unpaid wages the defendant owed the victim and the credit card charges incurred by the victim's credit card, and transferred the remaining 219,420 won to the defendant's account.\nHowever, in reality, the defendant, without any significant assets and struggling with the operation of the jointly operated bar and restaurant, including defaulting on wages, had neither the intention nor the ability to repay the loans on time even after borrowing the money from the victim in such a manner.\nThus, the defendant deceitfully obtained a total of 39.8 million won from the victim under the guise of loans and embezzled it.\n\nCase Number: 2021고단3299\n2. On August 16, 2021, at approximately 00:36, the defendant drove a K5 sedan (vehicle registration number omitted) while under the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.158%, from the road in front of K Apartment in Buk-gu, Gwangju, to the road in front of M Elementary School in Buk-gu, Gwangju, covering a distance of about 500 meters.",

Therefore, while this warrant explains the elements of the crime of fraud, it has no direct relevance to the crime of computer and other similar electronic equipment fraud, making its logical connection to the core issue of this case weak. The crime of fraud and the crime of computer and other similar electronic equipment fraud are legally distinct offenses, each with its own set of elements. Thus, this warrant provides the weakest link in the discussion of the crime of computer and other similar electronic equipment fraud in this case.",
